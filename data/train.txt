Monica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
Joey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
Chandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Phoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?

Phoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
Monica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Chandler: Sounds like a date to me.

Chandler: That's right.
Joey: Never had that dream.
Phoebe: No.

Chandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
Ross:  Hi.
Joey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
Monica: Are you okay, sweetie?

Ross: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
Chandler: Cookie?
Monica:  Carol moved her stuff out today. 
Joey: Ohh.

Monica:  Let me get you some coffee.
Ross: Thanks.
Phoebe: Ooh! Oh! 

Joey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
Ross: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Chandler: And I just want a million dollars! 
Monica: Rachel?!
Rachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Waitress: Can I get you some coffee?

Monica:  De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? 
Rachel: Hi, sure!
Ross: Hi. 

Phoebe:  If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off. Chandler:  Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants. Joey: I say push her down the stairs. Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey:  Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Rachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Ross: You can see where he'd have trouble.

Rachel: I'm all better now.
Phoebe:  I helped!
Monica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.
Joey:  And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.

Monica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
Joey: What, like there's a rule or something?
Chandler: Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
Paul:  It's, uh, it's Paul.

Monica: Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!
Joey: Who's Paul?
Ross: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?

Monica:  Really?
Ross:  No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
Phoebe: What does that mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? 

Monica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
All: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
Chandler: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?

Monica: Change!  Okay, sit down.  Two seconds.
Phoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
Joey:  Hey, Paul!
Paul: Yeah?

Joey: Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
Monica:  Shut up, Joey!
Ross: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Rachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!

Ross: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Chandler:  Yes, and we're very excited about it. 
Rachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.

Ross:  I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
Joey: I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
Chandler: It's a beautiful thing.

Joey: Done with the bookcase!
Chandler: All finished!
Ross:  This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.

Joey: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
Ross: You guys.
Chandler: Oh, God.

Ross: I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
Joey: Shut up!
Chandler: You must stop! 

Ross:  Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you? 
Joey: Great story!  But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, 
Chandler: Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.

Rachel: Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
Chandler: That is amazing.
Joey: Congratulations. 

Rachel: Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
Chandler: If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
Joey: Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something...  Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
Monica:  Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
All: Morning. Good morning.
Paul:  Morning.

Monica: We'll talk later.
Paul: Yeah.  Thank you. 
Joey: That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?

Monica: Shut up, and put my table back.
All: Okayyy! 
Chandler: All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... 
Rachel: So, like, you guys all have jobs?

Monica: Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
Joey: Yeah, I'm an actor.
Rachel: Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?

Joey: You should both know, that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler?  Monica: So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
Rachel: I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
Monica: I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?

Joey: Of course it was a line! 
Monica: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that? 
Ross: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'. 

Monica: I just thought he was nice, y'know? 
Joey:  I can't believe you didn't know it was a line! 
Rachel: Guess what? 
Ross: You got a job? 

Rachel: Thank you. 
Phoebe: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. 
Ross: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'... 
Monica: All right, you ready?

Ross: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,... 
All: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... 
Rachel: Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
Monica:  Rachel!  That was a library card! 

All: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Chandler:  Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. 
Monica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it! 

Monica: You be okay? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.  What? 

Monica: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody. 
Ross and Rachel: Goodnight.
Ross: Mmm.  Oh, no- 
Rachel: Sorry- 

Joey: I can't believe what I'm hearing here. 
Phoebe:  I can't believe what I'm hearing here... 
Monica: What? I-I said you had a- 

Phoebe: Oh, was I doing it again?
All: Yes!
Monica: I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
Joey: Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
Ross: There's an image. 
Rachel:  Would anybody like more coffee? 
Chandler: Did you make it, or are you just serving it? 

Rachel: I'm just serving it. 
All: Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee. 
Chandler: Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. 
Customer:  Ahh, miss?   More coffee? 

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Joey: Yeah, right!.......Y'serious? 
Phoebe: Oh, yeah! 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 

Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 

Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one!  
Monica:  Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 

Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead. 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine! 

Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Phoebe: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 

Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
All: Eeaagh! 
Rachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring? 
Phoebe: Yeah, it's beautiful. 

Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it.  Won't we! 
Chandler and Joey: Oh! Yeah!
Joey: Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 

Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica:  I just... can't do it. 

Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: .....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 

Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Phoebe:  Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 

Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.  
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 

Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 

Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mr. Geller:  Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she? 

Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 

Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that...  
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah.  

Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles... 

Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -I'd want yours. 

Ross: Must pee.  
Phoebe: Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins. 
Rachel: You're twins? 

Phoebe: She's a waitress. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.  
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 

Ross:  Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Susan: Hi. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 

Rachel:  Are you sure? 
Barry: Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours. 
Robbie: Huh?! 

Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Carol: Julia.. 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 

Barry: You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit. 
Rachel: What? 
Robbie: Me.  

Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 

Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Susan: Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is! 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 

Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman:  Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea? 
All: Yeah. Yeah. A little. 

Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Joey: Yeah, right!.......Y'serious? 
Phoebe: Oh, yeah! 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 

Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.

Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 

Phoebe:  Hi guys! 
All: Hey, Pheebs! Hi! 
Ross: Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go? 

Phoebe: Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!' 
All: Ohh. Ouch. 
Rachel: What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? 
Monica: Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'. 

Rachel: Since when? 
Joey: Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'. 
Chandler: Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. 
Phoebe: Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'. 

Rachel: And everybody knows this? 
Joey: Yeah. Cushions the blow. 
Chandler: Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. 
Ross: That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm. 
Monica: Uh, Ross. 

Monica: No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger. 
Joey: That's ridiculous! 
Ross: Can I use.. either thumb? 
Rachel:  Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!  Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this! 
All: Yeah. Yeah, excellent. 

Rachel:  Good for me! 
Joey: Y'okay, Phoebe? 
Phoebe: Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank. 
Monica: What did they do to you? 

Phoebe: Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt. 
Rachel: Chandler, what are you doing? 
Monica:  Hey. Whaddya doing? 
All: Oh! Oh, God! 
Ross: What is this?! 
Chandler: I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking. 

Phoebe: Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years! 
Chandler: And this- is my reward! 
Ross: Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit. 

Chandler: All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.  
Phoebe: Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now! 
Monica: Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date. 
Rachel: This Alan again? How's it goin'? 

Joey: Let it go, Ross. 
Ross: Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi. 
Monica: Do you all promise? 
All: Yeah! We promise! We'll be good! 

Monica:  Chandler? Do you promise to be good? 
Joey: You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! 
Ross: Hey, Pheebs. 
Phoebe: 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! 
Rachel: What bank is this? 

Monica: Hey. It's him.  Who is it? 
Alan:  It's Alan. 
Joey:  Chandler! He's here! 

Monica: Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan. 
Alan: Hi. 
All: Hi, Alan. 

Monica: C'mon! 
Ross: ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him. 
All: Loved him! Yeah! He's great! 

Monica: Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with? 
All: Yeah! 
Rachel: And did you notice...?  
The Guys:  Yeah. 
Joey: Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked. 
Phoebe: Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe! 
Ross: ...What shoe? 

Phoebe: From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...' 
Ross: ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured. 
Rachel: What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it. 
Monica: Really! 
Chandler: Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?  

Monica: Hi.. how was the game? 
Ross: Well.. 
All: WE WON!! Thank you! Yes! 

Monica: Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible? 
Joey: Alan. 
Ross: He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-... 
Rachel: I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. 
Chandler: Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.. 

Ross: A thumb?! 
All: Eww! 
Phoebe: I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker! 
Chandler: Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five? 

All: Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out! 
Rachel: It's worse than the thumb! 
Chandler: Hey, this is so unfair! 
Monica: Oh, why is it unfair? 

Chandler: So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this? 
Joey: ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? 
Rachel: Well, I-I could live without it. 

Joey: Oh,  "you do, do you"? 
Ross: You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. 
Rachel: "Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work. 
Phoebe: Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. 

Joey: Do you have any respect for your body? 
Ross: Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? 
Chandler: Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. 
Rachel:  Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you. 

Chandler: Really? He does?  Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!  
Rachel:  God, he's good. 
Ross: If only he were a woman. 

Chandler: Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too. 
Ross: Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.  
Monica:  Hey. Where's Joey? 

Chandler: Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong? 
Rachel: I think he's across the hall. 
Monica: Thanks.  
Ross:  There y'go. 

Chandler:  Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now. 
Ross: Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs? 
Phoebe: Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart? 

Ross: Hey, I might! 
Phoebe: Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb. 
All: You're kidding. Oh my God. 

Phoebe: And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?! 
Joey:  What's going on? 
Monica: Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together. 

Joey: Oh, God!  
Monica:  Okay.. 
All: Oh! That was Lambchop! 

Monica: No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change. 
Rachel: We didn't change.. 
Joey: So that's it? It's over? Just like that? 
Phoebe: You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-  

Monica: I'm sorry.. 
Chandler:  Oh, she's sorry! I feel better! 
Rachel:  I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family- 

Rachel: Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun. 
Ross: Yeah. He could row like a viking. 
Monica:  Hi. 
All: Mmm. 

Ross: So how'd it go? 
Monica: Oh, y'know.. 
Phoebe: Did he mention us? 

Monica: He said he's really gonna miss you guys.  
Ross: You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.  
Chandler: ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes. 
All: No no no! 

Monica: Alright. Phoebe? 
Phoebe: Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs! 
Ross: Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you? 
Chandler: Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever. 
Rachel: See, there's always one guy.  "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."  
All: Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy. 

Monica: ..Excuse me? 
Joey: Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live! 
Ross: Joey, uh- OMnipotent. 

Monica: Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. 
Phoebe:  Oh! What what what! ...Hi. 
Ross: It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. 

Monica: What's going on with you? 
Phoebe: I got no sleep last night! 
Ross: Why? 

Phoebe: Thanks. 
Joey: ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. 
Chandler: You got waaaay too much free time. 

Joey: So? 
Ross: So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? 
Chandler: Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty." 

Ross: Ohhh. 
Joey: What's wrong with the twentieth? 
Chandler: Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone? 

Ross: Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship.  Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover. 
Joey: The hell with hockey, let's all do that! 
Chandler:  C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy,  Huh? Huh? Huh? 

Ross: What are you doing? 
Chandler:  I have no idea. 
Joey: C'mon, Ross! 

Ross: Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? 
Chandler: You got it.
Rachel: Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! 
Phoebe: I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. 
Monica: Wow, you worked in a mine? 

Phoebe: I worked in a Dairy Queen, why? 
Rachel: God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totallynot worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that. 
Chandler:  Oh, this is not that bad. 
Joey: Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. 
Ross: You can totally, totally live on this. 
Monica: Yeah, yeah. 

Ross: Oh, by the way, great service tonight. 
All: Oh! Yeah! 
Guys: Hockey!  Hockey! Hockey.  
Leslie:  Rachel? 
Rachel: Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne all scream and hug each other. 
Monica:  I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom. 

Rachel: What are you guys doing here? 
Kiki: Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true! 
Joanne: Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play. 

Chandler: We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes. 
Ross: Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we-  Sorry. Sorry. 
Joey: What? 

Rachel: So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! 
Kiki: Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar! 
Joanne: Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. 

Monica: You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing! 
Rachel: Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what? 
Phoebe: You are just like Jack. 

Rachel: ...Jack from downstairs? 
Phoebe: No, Jack and the Beanstalk. 
Monica: Ah, the other Jack. 

Phoebe: Floopy? 
Rachel: Yeah. 
Monica: So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy. 

Phoebe: Oh, like that's a word. 
Rachel: Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together? 
Monica: ...Pheebs? 

Ross: Pass it! Pass it! 
Chandler: He's open! 
All: Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! 

Chandler: Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.  
Receptionist:  Hold on.  Fill these out, sit over there.  
Ross:  Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented. 

Rachel: I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down. 
Monica: No, you were right. I don't have a plan.  
Pizza Guy:  Pizza guy! 

Rachel: Thank God. Food.  
Monica: Phoebe? 
Phoebe: What? 

Monica: Do you have a plan? 
Phoebe: I don't even have a 'pl'. 
Pizza Guy: Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion? 
Rachel:  No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. 

Pizza Guy: Yeah, that sounds about right. 
Monica: Was he wearing a stunning blue suit? 
Phoebe: And-and a power tie? 

Pizza Guy: So you guys want me to take this back? 
Monica: Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!  
Rachel: Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus? 
Phoebe: Big Bird's friend. 

Monica: I see pizza! 
Phoebe: Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!  
Rachel: Hello? Who are we spying on? 

Monica: White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt? 
Rachel: Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him! 
Phoebe: Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman. 

Monica: Oh. Maybe they're- napping. 
Rachel: Oh please, they're having sex. 
Monica and Phoebe: Shut up! 

Rachel: So, whaddya think George is like? 
Monica: I think he's shy. 
Phoebe: Yeah? 

Ross: I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow. 
Chandler: Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please? 
Joey: He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that. 

Ross: It was my first time. 
Joey: With Carol?  Oh. 
Chandler: So in your whole life, you've only been with oneoh. 

Monica: What?! You slept with Jason? 
Phoebe: You'd already broken up. 
Rachel: How long? 

Phoebe: A couple hours. 
Monica: Oh, that's nice! 
Rachel: Okay, okay, okay, I got one!  Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me. 

Monica: Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade! 
Rachel: I was laughing! You made me laugh!  
Phoebe: There he is! There he is! 

Monica: Where? 
Phoebe: Right- where we've been looking all night! 
Rachel: He is so cute! 

Joey: Really? 
Chandler: No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..  
Both: Hey, buddy. 
Ross: Hi.  
Receptionist:  Oh, that's attractive. 

Chandler: Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight. 
Ross: Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? 
Joey: Oh, ah- the kid has it. 

Ross: The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck. 
Kid: I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.  
Chandler: You gotta do it, man. 

Ross: 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme! 
Kid: No! No!  
Receptionist: Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER! 

Ross:  Okay, Monica: Right foot red. 
Monica: Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo. 
Chandler: Thanks.  

Ross: Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.  
Chandler: Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people. 
Rachel: Oh, okay. Will you take my place? 

Chandler: Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel. 
Rachel: Nooo!   Hello?  Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much.  Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really. 
Ross: Green. To the green. 

Monica: Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
Ross: Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Rachel: Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
Chandler: We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
Joey: Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
Phoebe: Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.

Chandler: No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
Joey: Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling. 
Phoebe: You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.

Chandler: Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her. 
Phoebe: No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony. 
Ross: Tony?
Monica: Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?

Phoebe: Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
Rachel:  Does anybody want anything else?
Ross: Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing.  Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.

Phoebe:  What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
Rachel: It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
Ross: That guy, he burns me up.

Rachel: Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
Chandler: Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
Monica: Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?

Rachel: Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
Phoebe:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Angela: Hi, Joey.
Joey: My god, Angela.
Monica: Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.

Phoebe: Are you gonna go over there?
Joey: No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.  Hey, Angela. 
Angela:  Joey.

Joey: You don't say.
Ross: So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
Rachel: Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.

Ross: Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Rachel: Sure.
Angela: Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
Joey: Bob? Who the hell's Bob?

Woman: No suds, no save. Ok?
Ross: What's goin' on?
Rachel: Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.

Monica:  He is so cute.  So, where did you guys grow up?
Angela: Brooklyn Heights.
Bob: Cleveland.

Rachel: Does it still hurt?
Ross: Yeah.
Phoebe:  What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
Monica: Hi.

Phoebe: Hey, how'd it go?
Joey: Excellent.
Monica: We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Ross: What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.

Monica:  Oh, I'm sorry.
Rachel: Where's Chandler?
Phoebe: Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
Chandler: I'm free! I'm free!

Rachel: God. I feel violated.
Monica: Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
Chandler:  Ross, ten o'clock.
Ross: Is it? Feels like two.

Chandler: Thank you, buddy.
Phoebe: Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
Monica: You could do that!

Chandler: Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.  
Aurora: Chandler?
All: Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Joey: Whadja think?

Chandler: Hey, kids. 
All: Hey.
Phoebe:  No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.

Chandler: Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
Aurora: 'We' would be me and Rick.
Joey: Who's Rick?

Chandler: Who's Rick?
Aurora: My husband.
All: Ooooohhh.

Chandler: Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
Aurora: Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
All: What?!

Chandler: Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
Phoebe: Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
Ross: No, of course not!  ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
Monica: What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
Joey: I couldn't do it.

Monica: Good for you, Joey.
Joey: When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
Ross: Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-

Ross: Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
Monica: We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
All: Yeah! C'mon!

Rachel: Well, whaddya think?
All: Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
Monica: ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.

All: Uh-oh...
Monica: How-how did that happen?
Rachel: I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.

Monica: Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot.  Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
Phoebe:  I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
Chandler: Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.

Monica: STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Ross: Monica? You're Mom.
Phoebe: Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Joey:  Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there!  That was my agent.  My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
All: Oh my God! Whoah!

Monica: Well, what's the part?
Joey: Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
Phoebe: Seriously, what-what's the part?

Monica: Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Joey: Thank you! 
Chandler: Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.

Monica: I warned you...
Rachel: Who is being loud?
Chandler: Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.

Monica: Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Chandler: Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. 
Rachel: Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?

Ross: Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
All: Hey!
Monica: Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Joey: Nope.

Ross: It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
Joey: I got fired.
All: Oh!

Joey: Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
Monica: Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Ross: Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?

Joey: Yeah? That's so nice! 
Monica: I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys. 
All: Night.
Rachel: Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?

Rachel: Wow, you guys, this is big.
Monica:  Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. 
Phoebe: Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma.  What's my number? 

Monica: I have no idea what you just said.
Chandler:  Put Joey on the phone.
Joey: What's up man?

Rachel: Alright, somebody.
Monica: OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
All: Whoooaa!
Ross: That's my sister.
Joey: OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.

Monica: Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Ross: Pheebs, what about you?
Phoebe: Oh... Milwaukee.
Rachel: Um... Ross?

Ross: The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Phoebe: Oh, Rachel.
Rachel: Oh come on, I already went.
Monica: You did not go!
All: Come on.

Rachel: Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed. 
Ross: Step back.
Joey: We have a winner!

Rachel: Oh Ross, you're so great. 
Joey: It's never gonna happen.
Ross:  What?

Joey: Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' 
Ross: Shhhh!
Rachel: What are you shushing?

Phoebe:  New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... 
Ross:  OK, here goes.
Joey: Are you going to do it?

Joey:  You'd better act surprised.
Phoebe: About what?
Monica: My surprise party!

Monica:  This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Joey: Sorry, that was wax.
Phoebe: Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Ross: Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Rachel: During a blackout? He'd get trampled!

Phoebe:  Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Rachel: Oh.  Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Mr. Heckles: Er, yeah, it's mine.

Phoebe: Wait a minute. What's his name?
Mr. Heckles: Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
Rachel: Bob Buttons?

Ross:  Lucky sixes....
Rachel:  Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Monica:  Hi!

Rachel: And Ross.
Monica: Hi!
Paolo: 

Rachel: Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
Ross: That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
Phoebe: Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.

Ross: That's... that's classic.
Rachel:  Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
Monica: If you want, I'll do it.
Phoebe: I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip.  But I won't.

Rachel: Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
Ross: Paolo. Hi.
Paolo: Ross!

Phoebe: Thanks.
Ross: Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Joey:  Bwah-hah-hah!

Chandler: Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
Monica: I did.
Phoebe: Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Joey: Not me.
Ross: Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.

Chandler: WHAT IS IT?!
Monica: Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
All: Yes. Absolutely. A quality.

Chandler: Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
Monica: Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome. 
Rachel: Oh my God! Calling from Rome!  Bon giorno, caro mio. 
Ross:  So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.

Ross: So, uh, how's she doing?
Aunt Lillian: The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
Monica: How-how are you, Mom?
Mrs. Geller: Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?

Monica: The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. 
Ross: Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
Mr. Geller: Not just restaurants, from our house.
Nurse: Mrs. Geller?

Ross: Bye, Nana. 
Monica: Ross!
Mrs. Geller: What is going on?!

Ross: She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
Aunt Lillian:  What's going on?
Mr. Geller: She may have died.

Aunt Lillian: She may have died?
Mr. Geller: We're looking into it.
Ross: I, uh, I'll go see. 
Nurse: This almost never happens!

Chandler: I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
Rachel:  Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
Phoebe: Yeah, you have homosexual hair.

Rachel: So, um, did she...
Ross: Twice.
Joey: Twice?
Phoebe: Oh, that sucks!

Joey: You guys okay?
Ross: I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
Phoebe: Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.

Ross: Nono, she's gone.
Monica: We checked. A lot.
Phoebe: Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know?  Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
Rachel: Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? 

Phoebe: Thanks!
Rachel: Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Joey: Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food!  ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?

Ross: I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
Aunt Lillian: You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
Mrs. Geller: You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.

Ross:  Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
Aunt Lillian: No, it really should be burgundy.
Mrs. Geller: Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?

Ross: Some days it's all I can think about. 
Phoebe:  Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
Rachel: Oh, you-you mean your earrings?

Phoebe: What'd I say?
Rachel:  Hm-m.
Monica: Are these the shoes?

Monica: It was a really beautiful service.
Mrs. Geller: It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart.  Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
Joey: What?
Chandler: Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.

Joey: No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
Chandler: You are a frightening, frightening man.
Rachel: Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
Ross: Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
Phoebe: God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!

Phoebe: Okay, it's in spasm.
Mrs. Geller: Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident. 
Chandler: Oh, no-
Andrea: Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.

Chandler: Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
Phoebe: Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
Ross: I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
Monica: Wow, those pills really worked, huh?

Ross: Oh.. you don't get it! 
Mr. Geller: Whaddya got there?
Joey:  Just a, uh... hearing disability.

Mr. Geller: Beautiful! 
Rachel:  Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Mrs. Geller:  Your grandmother would have hated this.
Monica: Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.

Rachel: Aww, look at the little thing.
Ross: Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Chandler: Who are those people?

Ross: Got me.
Monica: Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'. 
Rachel: Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?

Monica: Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Ross: Looks like a fun gang. 
Joey: Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!

Rachel: Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go. 
Monica: Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
Ross: No, they're not.

Monica: No, I just talked to them.
Ross:  I'm calling Mom.
Joey: Hey, hey.
Chandler: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey.

Chandler: That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
Phoebe: What were you modeling for?
Joey: You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Monica: Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?

Phoebe: You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
Chandler: Do you know which one you're gonna be?
Joey: No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...  

Chandler: Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
Joey: Thanks.
Ross:  Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving. 
Monica: Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.

Ross: Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Monica: You know, they're not actually supposed to have...  I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
Joey: Yeah.

Monica: Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
Rachel: Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
Chandler: I thought it was $98.50.

Rachel: Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
Ross: Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Phoebe: Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?

Ross: Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
Phoebe: Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
Chandler: I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
Monica: Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
Rachel: No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.

Monica:  Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
Rachel: Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Chandler: All right, I'm nine years old.
Ross: Oh, I hate this story.

Monica: All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
Ross: That's closer.
Rachel: I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
Chandler: Oh, you must stop shooping.

Rachel: Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
Joey: Chandler, will you just come in already?
Chandler: No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Phoebe: Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!

Chandler: Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
Joey: Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
Monica: That's not a question.

Joey: But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
Monica: All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
Ross: Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child. 

Monica: Ah!
Ross: Ok, Mom never hit.
Phoebe:  Ok, all done.

Monica: Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Rachel: Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
Chandler: The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
Joey: The balloon?

Rachel: I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Phoebe: Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
Monica: Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?

Rachel: No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
Chandler: Do either of you have the keys?
Monica:  The oven is on.

Rachel: Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
Joey: Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
Monica: Well then get it, get it!

Ross: Does it always, uh--?
Carol: No, no that was the first.
Susan: Keep singing! Keep singing!

Joey: Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Monica: Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Chandler:  For an emergency just like this.
Rachel:  All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this  right now. But I'm not.

Monica: I swear you said you had the keys.
Rachel: No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
Phoebe: Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.

Monica: No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross?  Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Rachel: Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
Joey: Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.

Monica: Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Chandler: Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Phoebe: Ooh. 
Rachel: What?

Phoebe: Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
Joey: I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
Monica: Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!

Phoebe: It's nice that he has someone.
Chandler: Shall I carve?
Rachel: By all means.

Chandler: Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
Ross: I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Monica:  Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Joey: Oh, I will.
Phoebe: Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.

Monica: Make a wish?
Phoebe: Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
Joey: The bigger half.
Chandler: I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
All: That's so sweet.
Ross: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Rachel: And a crappy New Year.

Ross: Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet. 
All: Oooh!
Monica: W-wait. What is that?

Ross: 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Monica: No, no, I don't.
Rachel: Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?

Ross: My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
Phoebe: That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Chandler: Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
Monica: Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?

Phoebe: So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
Chandler: Might wanna open with the snowman.
All: Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.
Monica: So, how'd it go?
Joey: Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
Ross: How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.

Joey: Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
Rachel: Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's?  Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
Chandler: Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!

Rachel: Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. 
Phoebe: Yeah, you wish!
Chandler: It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
All: Yeah, okay. Alright.

Chandler: Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. 
All: Woooo! Yeah!
Rachel: Phoebe, you're on.
Phoebe: Oh, oh, good.

Phoebe: Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
Chandler:  That guy's going home with a note!
David: Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-

Phoebe: Could you speak up please?
David:  Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought
Max: Daryl Hannah.

Ross: Just a smidge.
Phoebe: David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
Monica: I think it's romantic.

Phoebe: No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
Chandler: Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
Monica: What?!
Ross: C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! 

Chandler: Aah, y'killing me!
Monica: Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Ross: Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?

Monica: Do you always have to bring him here?
Ross: I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Chandler: Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.

Ross: So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
Monica: I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Chandler: Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?

Monica: Yeah.
Joey: You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Chandler: I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Rachel:  Okay, here we go...

Joey: Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
Rachel:  There. Now there is.
Ross: Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.

Joey: Uh, four.
Ross: Four.
Rachel: Five.

Ross: Five. 
Rachel: Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
Joey: Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?

Ross: No.
Chandler: Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
Max: Phoebe. Hi. 
Phoebe: Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?

Phoebe: Oh, you're not going?  Oh, why?
Max: Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!' 
David: Thank you, Max. Thank you.

Janice: I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! 
Chandler: You remember Janice.
Monica: Vividly.

Monica: Hi.
Sandy: Hi, I'm Sandy.
Joey: Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.

Sandy: Yeah. That's okay, right?
Ross: Par-tay! 
Monica: That thing is not coming in here.

Ross: Thank you.  C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling?  Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
Monica: Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
Rachel: Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
Phoebe: And then... your face is bloated?

Rachel: No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party?  Are people eating my dip?
Sandy: Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
Joey: Wow, that's, uh, dirty.

Sandy: Yeah.
Joey: Hey, kids...
Ross:  Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
Janice:  There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
Chandler:  But you found me!

Janice: Here, Ross, take our picture.  Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
Chandler: Kill me. Kill me now. 
Monica: Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Fun Bobby: Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
Joey:  Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?

Fun Bobby: It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.
Janice:  Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
Chandler: Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-

Janice: Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me. 
Chandler: Oh, will you give me the thing. 
Phoebe: Hi, Max!
Max: Yoko.  I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
David: Wow.

Max: It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.
Phoebe: Are you alright?
David: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. 

Phoebe: And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it.  I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
Dick Clark:  Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
Joey: There y'go, kids.
Chandler:  And then the peacock bit me.  Please kiss me at midnight. 

Joey: You seen Sandy?
Chandler: Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
Rachel: Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
All:  What?

Rachel: The bll is drrbing!
Dick Clark:  In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
Chandler: And the moment of joy is upon us.
Joey: Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
Phoebe: Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
Monica: Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!

Chandler: Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. 
Phoebe: I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
Rachel: I can't kiss anyone.
Monica: So I'm kissing everyone?
Joey: Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
Ross: Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.

Phoebe: Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.
Monica: He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Guy: Nice hat.
Monica and Phoebe:  Thanks.

Chandler: Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
Monica: He doesn't have anyone.
Phoebe: Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
Joey: I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Rachel: Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! 
Jay Leno:  Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.

Chandler: Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
Rachel: No way, forget it.
Joey: C'mon, she's your mom!

Chandler: You can say that because she's not your mom.
Ross: Oh, please...
Paolo: Bona sera.
Rachel: Oh, hi sweetie. 

Ross: Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
Phoebe: Hey hey hey! She's on!
Paolo: Ah! Nora Bing!
Jay Leno:  ...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?

Phoebe: Your mom was arrested?
Chandler: Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
Mrs. Bing:  ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...

Chandler: Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
All: Shhh.
Mrs. Bing:  ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.

Chandler: THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Jay Leno:  Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
Mrs. Bing:  Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
All: Awww!

Chandler: This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Jay Leno:  Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
Mrs. Bing:  Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.

Mrs. Bing: Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
Chandler: Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
Ross:  What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.

Mrs. Bing: Who's doing shots?
Monica: Yeah.
Phoebe: I'm in.

Mrs. Bing: There y'go. Ross?
Ross: Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
Rachel: Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.

Ross: Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Rachel: Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
Mrs. Bing: Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Chandler: Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.

Ross: What code?
Joey: You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
Chandler: What are you guys doing out here?

Ross: No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Joey: Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Chandler: Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. 

Rachel: Goodbye, baby.
Paolo: Ciao, bela.
Ross: Do they wait for me to do this?
Joey: So are you gonna tell him?

Ross: Oh...
Monica:  What are you guys doing here?
Joey: Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!

Chandler: I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
Joey: Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
Ross: Thanks, man, big help.

Chandler: I can't believe you did this. 
Ross: Chandler-
Joey: Me neither, y'know what-

Chandler: I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
Joey: What are you mad at me for?!
Ross: Chandler-

Chandler: You gotta let me slam the door! 
Joey:  Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did!  See what happens when you break the code?
Ross: Joey-

Monica:  Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
Phoebe:  Hey Rach.
Rachel: Hey.

Phoebe: Okay, maybe it was a trick question.  Um, Rachel can we do this now?
Rachel: Okay.  I am so hot!
Joey:  Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
Ross: I cannot believe we're having this conversation.

Joey: C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
Rachel:  Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Phoebe: Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me.  'Kay.  

Rachel:  Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
Chandler: What was that?
Ross: Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...

Chandler: Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? 
Joey:  Mother-Kisser...  I'll shut up.
Ross: Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.

Phoebe: Look at you! How, how do you feel?
Coma Guy: Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
Monica: You look good!

Coma Guy: I feel good! ...Who are you?
Monica: Oh, sorry.
Phoebe: I'm Phoebe Buffay.

Monica: I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Phoebe: Well, we both have.
Coma Guy: So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?

Phoebe: I sang.  Hah!
Coma Guy: Well,... thanks.
Monica: Oh, my pleasure.

Phoebe: What, that's it? 
Monica: "See you around?"
Coma Guy: Well, what do you want me to say?

Monica: Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?" 
Coma Guy: Alright, I'll call you.
Phoebe: I don't think you mean that.

Mrs. Bing: Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
Chandler: Yeah. No. No...
Ross: Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Joey: Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.

Ross: Whaddya see?
Joey: Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
Mrs. Bing: You okay, kiddo?
Chandler: Yeah, okay.

Mrs. Bing: Alright. 
Chandler: Nice save.
Ross:  Mrs. Bing.

Mrs. Bing: Mr. Geller.
Chandler: Hey.
Ross: You mean that?

Rachel: Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
Monica: What's a 'niffle'?
Joey: You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.

Monica: Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna.  Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
Joey: Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
Ross: Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! 
Phoebe: Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. 
Chandler: And, we're done with the yogurt. 

Phoebe:  Sorry. 
Monica: Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas?  Nice talk, Aunt Syl.  You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
Joey: Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?  This is your baby.  Hi Daddy! 
Ross:  Hello!

Joey:  How come you don't live with Mommy?  How come Mommy lives with that other lady?  What's a lesbian? 
Rachel: Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos 
Paolo: Ah, poke  a  nose, mmm 
Joey, Chandler, and Ross:  Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Monica: So, did I hear Poconos?

Rachel: Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
Phoebe: Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
Monica: Yeah, that's a big step.

Rachel: I know...
Chandler:  Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
Ross: Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?

Ross: Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
Susan: Oh, that's so...  It really is...do we know...?
Carol: Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...

Ross:  Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
Susan: Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
Carol: Mm-hmmm 

Ross: No problem, ok, mmmwa  oh, mmmwa  Susan... 
Susan: All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona? 
Carol: Hello?

Phoebe's Assistant: Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum 
Paolo: Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!
Phoebe: Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?

Rachel:  I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows.... 
Monica: And Monica knows...
Ross: Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!

Monica: Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
Joey: So what's it gonna be? 
Ross: Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!

Monica: I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
Joey: Or an uncle... 
Joey and Chandler: Hey Phoebe!
Ross: Hi Pheebs!
Rachel: Pheebs!
Phoebe: Fine!

Monica: Phoebe, what's the matter?
Phoebe: Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
Customer: Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
Rachel: Oh, right, that's me!
Joey: Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
Chandler: Fine. 

Monica: Phoebe, what is it?
Phoebe: All right, you know Paolo?
Ross: I'm familiar with his work, yes...

Monica: Well, what happened?
Phoebe: Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until. 
Joey and Chandler:  Ooooohh!
Ross: My God.

Monica: Was it...?
Phoebe: Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
Guys: Oooooo....
Rachel: "Ooo," what?

Phoebe: Uma Thurman.
Monica: Oh!
Ross: The actress!

Ross: You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? 
Chandler: Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
Joey: Feminist issue. That's where I went!
Phoebe: She is gonna hate me.

Chandler: I know!
Monica: So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Joey: Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!

Phoebe: I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
Rachel: Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
Rachel and Phoebe: I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! 

Phoebe: I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
Monica: We should get over there and see if she's okay.  Just one...second! Score!  Game! Come on. 
Ross:  Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
Joey: No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.

Paolo: No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
Ross:  How's it going?
Monica: Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes! 
Phoebe: Ooh!

Paolo: Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
Phoebe: Oh, ok bye-bye.
Monica: Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel,  but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.

Paolo: Grazie.
Ross: Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say... 
Phoebe: Oh, just look at her... 

Ross: Ohhhh 
Monica: Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
Rachel: Oh...
Phoebe: You ok?

Rachel: ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
Phoebe: Yep!
Ross: See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.

Rachel: Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
Ross: Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy!  Huh, am I having a boy?
Girls: Yes, you're having a boy! 

Ross: I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
Chandler: Wha-
Joey: Wha-
Joey and Chandler: What is it?

Ross: I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Joey and Chandler: We already knew that! 

Monica: Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Joey: Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Chandler: Yeah, get out!

Phoebe: Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
Rachel: Okaaay.  Any of you guys want anything else?
Chandler: Oh, yes, could I have one of those. 

Rachel: No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Chandler: Okay.
Roger: Did I, uh, did I miss something?

Chandler: It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
Rachel: Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
Phoebe: Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.

Rachel: Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
Chandler: Okaaay,  rock, hard place, me.
Roger: You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.

Chandler: Uhhuh, how did you know that?
Roger: It's textbook.
Joey: Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
All: Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
Monica: Hey, how long are you in the city?
Mr. Tribbiani: Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry.  I don't know this one.
Phoebe: Oh, this is my friend Roger.

Roger: You too, sir.
Mr. Tribbiani:  What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
Joey: Dad, dad. 

Joey: It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.  That'd be cool.... This blows!
Rachel: I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents?  Why do they have to become people? Why do they have...  Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
Chandler:  What?  What?

Rachel: Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Ross: Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
Chandler: Y'know, I don't see that happening?

Rachel: C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
Chandler: Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
Monica: Hello?
Phoebe:  It's Phoebe.
Roger:  And Rog.

Monica: C'mon up.
Chandler:  Oh, good. Rog is here.
Joey: What's the matter with Rog?
Ross: Yeah.

Ross: Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
Roger: I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
Monica: Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.

Roger: Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
Ross: That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Monica: Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
Phoebe: Isn't he good?

Ross: Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
Rachel: You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in. 
Roger: That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going. 
Phoebe: Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?

Roger: Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...
Phoebe: Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
Monica: You're welcome.

Ronni: That's a good one!
Mr. Tribbiani: Hey, Joe.
Joey: Dad, Ronni's here.

Mr. Tribbiani: Thank you. Uh...
Chandler: So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Ronni: Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.

Mr. Tribbiani: I don't want you taking that thing.
Ronni: Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
Joey: Who-ah-ho.

Mr. Tribbiani: We'll go to a hotel.
Ronni:  We'll go to a hotel.
Joey: No you won't.

Ronni: No we won't.
Joey: If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
Mr. Tribbiani: You're gonna keep an eye on us?

Joey: Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Ronni: Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
Chandler: C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late." 

Ronni: Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
Rachel: Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time.  Hey, Mr. Trib. 
Mr. Tribbiani: Hey. Morning, dear.

All: Hey, Pheebs.
Phoebe: Hey. 
Monica: How's it going?

Phoebe: So what's going on?
Monica: Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger. 
Ross: I dunno, there's just something about...
Chandler: Basically we just feel that he's...
Rachel: We hate that guy.
All: Yeah. Hate him.

Monica: So you talked to your dad, huh.
Joey: Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
Rachel: Wow.
Chandler: Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
Ross: So Joey, you okay?

Joey: Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
Rachel: Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
Chandler: If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
Phoebe:  Hey.
All: Hey, Pheebs.
Monica: How's it going?

Phoebe: Yeah, right.
All: Aaawwwwww!!
Rachel: What happened?

Phoebe: Hey, Joey. What's going on?
Joey: Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. 
Monica: Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!

Joey: I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
Ross: She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Chandler: Any contact?

Ross: Hey. 
Chandler: Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third... 
Joey: Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.

Ross: An egg?
Joey: Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
Chandler: I think it's winning.

Ross: I think it's insane.
Chandler: She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
Joey: Think it'll work?

Monica: Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
Rachel: No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
Phoebe: 'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!

Monica: But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do. 
Rachel: Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Joey: Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Chandler: Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...

Joey:  How do I look?
Chandler: Oh, uh, I... don't... care.  Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Lorraine: Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.

Rachel: How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
Monica: I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
Phoebe: I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.

Monica: There's more beer, right?
Phoebe: Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
Rachel: Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.

Lorraine: You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
Joey: Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
Janice: By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
Chandler: That's OK.

Janice: Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
Joey:  We can't do that.
Chandler:  What? What can't you do?

Monica: Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Janice: Hi, Monica.
Chandler: Ok, well, this was very special.

Monica: Rach, come see who's out here!
Rachel: Oh my god. Janice, hi!
Chandler: Janice is gonna go away now.

Monica: I'll be right back.
Rachel: Oh, Joey, look who it is.
Joey:  Whoa.
Chandler: Oh, good, Joey's home now.
Janice: This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.

Phoebe: Um, that's ok!  Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
Rachel: Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
Monica: Can we just start throwing things in?

Phoebe: Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Monica: Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Rachel:  Hey he's wearing a sweater.

Monica: No.
Rachel and Phoebe: Eww!
Rachel: And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.

Ross: So, um, what do you do for a living?
Kristin: Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
Carol: Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you. 
Susan: I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry. 

Fireman No. 1: What do we got there?
Fireman No. 2: A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
Monica: You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
Fireman No. 3: It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.

Fireman No. 3: I'll even let you ring the bell.
Rachel: Oh, my god.
Phoebe: See, there you go, the cleansing works!
Monica: They're nice guys.

Woman: Chandler.
Chandler: Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
Mrs. Tedlock: Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.

Phoebe: Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
Chandler: Hey!
All: Hey!

Phoebe: Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
Ross: What's going on?
All: What is it?
Chandler: So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.

All: Why?
Chandler: Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
Monica: Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.

Chandler: Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
Rachel:  Oh. That WENUS.
Joey: So what're you going to do?

Chandler: I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Phoebe: Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve?  Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
Monica:  Um... hi there.

Chandler: Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
Rachel: No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
Phoebe: Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?

Chandler: Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
Ross: Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
Monica: Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
Phoebe: Ooh! Brian's Song!
Rachel: The meeting with the guy went great?

Monica: So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
Rachel: What are you going to make?
Phoebe:  Yummy noises.

Rachel:  And Monica, what are you going to make?
Monica: I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
Phoebe: Ooh! I know what you could make!  I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff?  You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know. 
Ross: Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
Joey: How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.

Ross: OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Chandler: Who are you going out with?
Phoebe: Oh, is this the bug lady?
Rachel:  Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.

Ross: Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
Chandler: And he's not speaking metaphorically.
Joey:  So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...  huh-huh?

Monica: Yeah, well, is that better?
Joey: I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
Rachel: My God! What happened to you?
Chandler: Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?  "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
Phoebe: That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!

Chandler: Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
Rachel:  Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Monica:  Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.

Chandler:  Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Monica:  Hello?  Oh, hi Wendy!  Yeah, eight o'clock.  What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?...  OK, great.  All right, I'll see you then. Bye. 
Phoebe: Ten dollars an hour for what?

Monica: Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
Rachel:  Waitressing?
Joey: Uh-oh.

Ross:  Funny story!
Joey: You're not going to believe this!
Chandler: It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.

Rachel: Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Monica: Hi Steve!
Steve: Hello, Monica.  Hello, greeter girl.

Monica:  This is Rachel.
Steve:  Yeah, OK.
Phoebe:  Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of  of, OK, smells.

Steve: I was just being polite, but, alright. 
Rachel: What's up?
Phoebe:  In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.

Rachel: Let me, let me get you some wine!
Monica: Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course.  OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
Steve: Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!

Monica: Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Steve: Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning. 
Rachel: Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?

Joey: What a tool!
Rachel: You don't want to work for a guy like that.
Ross: Yeah!
Monica: I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.

Ross: Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
Phoebe: Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
Joey:  So, er... how did it go with Celia?

Chandler: Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
Ursula: Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, hello Miss," so now Im here.
Joey: No, no... how come you are working here?

Ross: And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
Rachel: Ive never done that.
Chandler: All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister.
Joey: Im sayin I see a difference.

Chandler: Lets not do that any more.
All: Hey guys! Hey!
Joey: Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
Phoebe: Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson.

Joey: Nope.
Phoebe: The woman who cuts my hair!
Monica: Okay, look, this could be a really long game.
Chandler: Your sister Ursula.

Phoebe: Its mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
Ross: Oh, Pheebs, Im sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.
Chandler: Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
Rachel: So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?

Woman: Hi, were the Rostins. Err, Im J.C., and hes Michael, and were having a boy, and a girl.
Teacher: Good for you. Alrighty, next?
Ross: Hi, um, Im err,  Im Ross Geller, and err ah...  ..thats, thats my boy in there, and uh,  this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carols, just, com...  ..whos next?

Teacher: Im sorry, I didnt get... Susan is?
Ross: Susan is Carols, Carols, Carols, friend...
Carol: Life partner.

Chandler: Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute.
Ross: It doesnt matter. You dont dip your pen in the company ink.
Monica: Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.

Ross:  How did he do this?
Chandler:  So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Monica: Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
Rachel: Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate...  How long has that been there?

Chandler: Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err... 
Joey: Pheebs?
Phoebe:  Yeah?

Joey: Cool, thanks.
Ross: You okay?
Phoebe: Yeah Im fine.

Ross: No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on.
Susan: Oh, good. Thisll be fun.
Teacher: Alrighty. Were gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why dont you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummys head.
Ross and Susan: What? What? What?

Rachel: Ooh, okay... good.
Jamie: What is this place?
Fran: Look, youre cold, I have to pee, and...  ..theres a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?

Jamie:  Your turn.
Fran: Err... we know what we want.
Phoebe:  Oh, thats good.

Jamie: All we want is two Caffe Lattes.
Fran: And some biscotti cookies.
Phoebe: Good choice.

Monica: Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
Chandler: Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?
Rachel: Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating.  "Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work?"
Joey: Hey.
Rachel and Chandler: Hey.

Monica: Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly.
Mr.Heckles: I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats cant sleep.
Rachel: You dont even have cats.

Mr.Heckles: I could have cats.
Monica:  Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
Rachel: Well try to keep it down.
Joey: Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Phoebe: Ooh, my first birthday present...  ..oh, this is really...

Joey: Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
Phoebe: Ohhh... Sure, yeah...  ..okay, it fits.
Rachel: Are you seein her again tonight?

Chandler: And thats the Chrysler Building right there.
Mr. Douglas: Nina.
Nina: Mr.Douglas...  ..cool tie.

Soothing male voice: ..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth.
Teacher: Lights please? And thats having a baby. Next week is our final class.
Ross: Susan, go deep.
Carol: This is impossible. Its just impossible.
Susan: What is, honey?

Ross: Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
Chandler: You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
Phoebe: Wherere you going?
Joey: Out.

Nina: Oh my god!  Youre amazing!
Chandler: Oh, you dont know.  Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
Helen:  So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?

Chandler: Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing.  Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand...  ..on the desk.
Monica: Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Phoebe: Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch.

Monica: Are you alright?
Phoebe: Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its...
Rachel: Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?

Phoebe: I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
Chandler: Youre not gonna lose him.
Monica: Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.

Rachel: Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Monica: Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
Nurse: My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?

Nurse: Fill this out and bring it back to me.
Rachel: Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
Monica: Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?

Rachel: Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
Monica:  Hi,  um, I'm gonna need a new set of  these forms .
Nurse: Why?

Ross: Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
Chandler: What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Joey: He should take the sack?

Ross: Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
Chandler: Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
Joey: Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.

Joey: Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
Ross: You take your time.
Chandler: There it is! So what're you gonna do?

Dr. Mitchell: Okay, errrr, Monica?
Monica: Yes?  ..yes, she is.
Rachel : Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
Monica : Hi.

Dr. Mitchell:  Hi, err Rachel. I'm Dr.Mitchell.
Dr. Rosen:  And I'm his friend, Dr.Rosen.
Rachel: Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?

Rachel: What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors,  cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
Chandler: Alright, what have we learned so far?
The Whole Party:  SURPRISE!!!
Ross: What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.

Rachel: Was that the cake?
Ross: Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
Monica: Come on, she'll be here any minute.

Rachel: I hope it's okay.
Monica: Oh...
Chandler:  "Happy Birthday Peehe."

Monica: Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.
Ross:  Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.
Phoebe: Hey, what's going on?

Monica: Hi, Geoffrey.
Rachel: Hi.
Dr. Rosen: Ah here, we brought wine.
Dr. Mitchell: Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?

Rachel: Oh, that's great. Look at that.
Dr. Rosen: So, Monica, how's the ankle?
Monica: It's uh...
Monica : ..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
Rachel : You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay...  STAT! 

Rachel: Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
Monica: A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
Dr. Mitchell: So?
Dr. Rosen: So... they sss-still seem normal.

Dr. Mitchell: Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine.  Go like this. 
Monica: I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
Rachel:  I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...

Rachel:  Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
Monica:  Yeah...  ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
Dr. Mitchell: Really?

Monica:  Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me.  Why don't you try the hummus?
Dr. Rosen: So, Monica, what do you do?
Rachel:  Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.

Dr. Rosen: This hummus is great.
Dr. Mitchell: God bless the chickpea.
Monica:   Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
Rachel:  And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?

Rachel:  Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business!  ...dead!
Monica: Ross, he's got the remote again.
Ross: Good. Maybe he can switch it back.

Rachel: It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
Rachel and Monica: Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
Monica: I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!

Rachel: Okay, let me just change.
Monica: Yes.
Joey:  Hey.
Ross and Chandler: Hey!

Monica: Hi.
Phoebe: Trouble?
Joey: Your sister stood me up the other night.

Rachel:  Hi, remember us?
Nurse:  Mmm hmmm.
Monica:  Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one  because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again.  'cause um...

Nurse: You're that stupid.
Monica:  I am. I'm that stupid. 
Rachel:  Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.

Ross: No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.
Monica: What's goin' on?
Chandler: Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
Rachel: Oh.
Nurse: Excuse me... This hospital is for people!

Ross: Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
Dr. Mitchell: I'll take a look at him.
Rachel and Monica: Oh, thank you.
Monica: Michael.

Dr. Mitchell: Rachel.
Rachel: What?
Monica:  Monica.

Ross: He looks so tiny.
Joey: We just got the message.
Phoebe: Is he alright?

Ross: No, why?
Chandler: Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
Monica: Oh, look, he's waking up!

Ross: Aqui est? 
Monica: A quin pidio el pollo General Tso? 
Chandler: Pudo aver sido General Tso! 
Rachel: Mira, mira, el viejo desnudo est?haciendo el hula hoop! 
All:Ewww! 

All: Hola, Joey! 
Joey: Hola, amigos! 
Monica: Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto. 
Ross: Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele! 

Ross: Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here.
Monica: Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?
Chandler: Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.
Rachel: Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse me...'

Monica: Hey, guys.
Chandler and Ross: Hey.
Rachel: Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?

Monica: Lots of responses.
Rachel: : Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
Phoebe: : Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh... 

Rachel: : We have apple cinnamon...
Monica: : OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No. 
Phoebe: Wow!

Rachel:  Give me that!
Chandler: You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
Ross: I don't know.

Chandler:  Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
Ross: Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... : Hiiii!
Rachel: Hi! How are you?

Ross: We're fine, we're fine.
Rachel: OK.  
Joey: Shut up!
Chandler: We're notwe're not saying anything.
Phoebe: What?

Ross: Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
Joey: Thank you.
Chandler:  We were playing poker, alright...

Joey: There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
Ross: Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
Chandler: And then he did.
Rachel: Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
Phoebe: Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?

Ross: No, women are welcome to play.
Phoebe: Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
Chandler: There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Joey: Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Girls: Oh, yeah, right.
Monica: Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Rachel: Really.

Chandler:  OK, so now we draw cards.
Monica: So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
Rachel: Oh, good for you!
Phoebe: Congratulations!

Chandler: OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
Phoebe: OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
Ross: No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can'tyou can't do...
Rachel: Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! 

Ross: Oh, you're... 
Monica: Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
Phoebe and Rachel: OOooooo!
Joey: Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
Chandler:  OK, so at this point, the dealer...

Monica: Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
Ross: Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
Phoebe: But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
Chandler: OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson.  Joey... three... eight. Eight... three.  Alright babe, deal the cards.

Monica:  Dammit, dammit, dammit!
Phoebe: : Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
Joey: About what?

Phoebe: A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
Rachel: OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow... 
Guys: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Chandler: Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.

Rachel: Settle what?
Chandler: The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
Ross: The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.

Rachel: Oh. Right.
Joey: You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
Monica: Hell no, we'll pay!
Phoebe: OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.

Monica: And you know what? We want a rematch.
Ross: Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
Rachel: : So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.

Rachel:  Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
Monica: Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
Phoebe: Ha. Ha, ha.

Monica: OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says.  Hi!
Aunt Iris: Is Tony Randall dead?
Rachel: No.

Monica: I don't think so.
Rachel: Why?
Aunt Iris: Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.

Monica: Really?
Aunt Iris: No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one.  Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings.
Phoebe: Thank y... 

Ross: Hey.
Rachel: Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Chandler: Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?

Rachel: Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
Monica: OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
Joey: Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
Chandler: Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?

Monica: Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
Phoebe and Rachel: Yes, we should. I think we should.
Ross: Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
Rachel: No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.

Ross: So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
Joey: But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
Phoebe: Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed.

Joey: What?
Phoebe: Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
Chandler: That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
Ross: Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
Rachel: Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women. 
Monica: You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.

Ross: So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
Rachel: Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
Monica: OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
Phoebe:  Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go.  Right, OK, serious poker.

Monica: Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
Ross: I want to go to the bathroom. 
Joey: Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. 
Rachel: Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.

Joey: That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Monica: Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. 
Phoebe:  Yes!  .... or no.
Ross: Alright. : Your money's mine, Green.
Rachel: Your fly is open, Geller. 

Phoebe: You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Chandler: Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Joey: Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?

Phoebe: Yeah. Um... I'm out. 
Rachel: I'm in.
Monica: Me too.
Joey: Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
Ross: Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. 

Rachel: I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Phoebe: Monica, in or out?
Monica:  I hate this game! 

Phoebe: Me too. Rachel.
Rachel: Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you.  What do you say... want to waste another buck?
Ross: No, not this time.  So... what'd you have?

Rachel: Get your hands out of there! No!
Ross: Let me see! Show them!
Chandler: Y'know, I've had dates like this.

Rachel:  Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
Phoebe: Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
Ross: First of all, I'm not losing...

Rachel: Barbara! Hi, how are you?  Uh-huh.  No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, pleaHello? Hello? 
Monica: Sorry, Rach.
Phoebe: Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.

Rachel: Yes, we do. 
Monica: Alright, check.
Joey: Check.
Ross: I'm in for fifty cents. 
Chandler: Call.
Phoebe: I'm in.

Rachel: : Thank you. : I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven.
Phoebe: ...teen! 
Ross: : Joey, I'm a little shy.
Joey: That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
Chandler: : What do you need, what do you need?

Ross: Fifteen.
Chandler: Alright, here's ten. 
Joey: Here, I got five, I got five. 

Ross: You got me.
Joey: : Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
Chandler: : I thought we had them!

Chandler: Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
Rachel: Oh, time's up.
Monica:  Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
Joey: Oh!
Phoebe: That's a bird?

Phoebe: That's a bird!
Rachel: OK, OK, it's my turn. 
Chandler: Go.
Ross: Uh.... bean! Bean!
Joey:  The Unbearable Likeness of Being!

Ross: ...Gets interrupted. Hi!
Rachel: Hi, how was the movie?
Monica: Wonderful!
Phoebe: So good!
Joey: Suck-fest.
Chandler: Toootal chick-flick.

Phoebe: I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
Joey: Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
Monica: There was nudity!

Joey: I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
Monica and Phoebe: Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Ross: Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
Chandler: They're still just friends, right?
Rachel:  And I will see you tomorrow!

Chandler: I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
Ross: I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
Joey: She really said that?

Rachel: Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
Phoebe:  Hey. 
All: Hi.

Phoebe: No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
Rachel: C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Joey: Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
Chandler: Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.

Rachel: Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
Mr. Heckles: Whaddyou want?
Monica: Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?

Mr. Heckles: I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
Monica: No!
Phoebe: Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?

Mr. Heckles: You owe me a waffle.
Rachel:  Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face...  ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
Ross: Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?

Ross: No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
Rachel:  Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I-  Oh! Who is it?
Intercom: Animal Control.

Rachel: Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
Monica: Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
Luisa: Marcel?
Ross: My uncle Marcel.
Phoebe: Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?

Luisa: Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
Phoebe: Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
Monica: Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?

Phoebe: Yes, but there isn't always time!
Monica: Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
Luisa: Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!
Rachel: Yeah!

Luisa: Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
Rachel: Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Monica: The Luisa from home room!

Rachel: Yes!!
Luisa: You have no idea who I am, do you.
Monica: No, none at all.

Rachel: None.
Luisa: Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
Monica: Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!

Luisa: Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems.  But you? What a bitch!
Rachel: What?!
Monica: Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?

Luisa: I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine. 
Phoebe: Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
Chandler: Marcel?
Joey: Marcel?

Chandler: Marcel?
Joey: Marcel?
Woman No. 1: Hi, can I help you?

Chandler: Yes have you seen any?
Woman No. 1: No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
Joey: Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?

Woman No. 1: Of course.
Joey: Oh. Then, no.
Woman No. 2: Did I put too much rum in here?

Woman No. 1: Just a sec.  Hope you find your monkey. 
Chandler: Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
Joey: Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?

Chandler: Marcel?!
Phoebe: Marcel?
Monica: Marcel?

Phoebe: Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!
Luisa: Step aside, ladies! 
Monica: What're you gonna do?

Luisa: Just a small tranquiliser.
Monica: Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel!  Are you okay?
Phoebe: Yeah, think so. Oh!  Huh.  Whoah.

Monica: Oh gosh.
Ross: Marcel?
Rachel: Marcel?

Phoebe: Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.
Ross: Hi, did you order some bananas?
Mr. Heckles: What about it?

Ross: Gimme back my monkey.
Mr. Heckles: I don't have a monkey.
Rachel: Then what's with all the bananas?

Ross: C'mere, Marcel. 
Mr. Heckles: C'mere, Patti. 
Luisa:  Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey!  Gotcha.

Ross: Okay, gimme my monkey back.
Mr. Heckles: That's my monkey.
Luisa: You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.

Mr. Heckles: That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.
Ross: Alright, I want my monkey.
Luisa: No!
Rachel: Oh, c'mon, Luisa!

Luisa: Sorry, prom queen.
Ross:  You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
Rachel: Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!

Ross: Alright.  The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming.  Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
Barry: Rachel.
Rachel: Barry?!

Monica: Well, high school was not my favourite time.
Joey: I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
Chandler: Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.

Chandler: I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
Joey: No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
Ross: I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
Monica:  Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!

Chandler: Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem?  I'm right, right?
Joey and Ross: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Monica: I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Phoebe: Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!

Chandler: Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
Monica: Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
Ross: Okay, okay, what's going on?
Phoebe: Okay, they're just talking...

Ross: What? What? What?!
Phoebe: That man across the street just kicked that pigeon!  Oh!
Chandler:  And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
All: Oh!... Right!

Chandler: Hey Rach!
Monica: How'd it go?
Rachel: Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
Phoebe: Not a good day for birds...

Rachel: Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
Ross: That's, that's nice twice!
Monica: Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
Joey: Duh, where've you been?

Rachel: Why?
Chandler: I have my reasons.
Monica: Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?

Chandler: Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
Monica:  Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
Phoebe: Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!

Monica: What kinda stuff?
Joey: Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
Phoebe: You cook naked?

Barry: Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
Rachel: No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me. 
Bernice:  Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.

Barry: We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.
Rachel: I had a bra.
Bobby: Hey, Dr. Farber.

Chandler: Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Joey: Maybe she never got your message.
Phoebe: Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.

Chandler: I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
All: Hey! Hi!
Phoebe: How'd he take it?
Rachel: Pretty well, actually... 
Monica:  Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?

Rachel:  We ended up having sex in his chair.
Monica: You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
Ross: You-you had what?
Phoebe: Sex in his chair.

Ross: No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
Rachel: Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say? 
Chandler: If it helps, I could slide over.

Ross:  I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
Chandler: Hello? Hello?
Rachel:  Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you?  Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great.  Really?  Oh.  Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and...  Okay...  Great...  Great...  All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow!  Okay..  Okay...  Bye.  Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.

Monica: Brrrrrrr!
Chandler: Hell is filled with people like you.
Joey:  He's back! The peeper's back!

Joey:  Get down!
Rachel: Get down?
Chandler: ...And boogie!

Rachel: Right, I'll see you guys later...
Joey: Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or-  That's fine, yeah...
Chandler: Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Monica: Why don't you just take it with you?

Ross: Thanks.
Joey:  Hey, you know our phone's not working?
Chandler: What?!

Joey: I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
Chandler:  I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Monica: Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.

Joey:  Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
Ross: "Heating device."
Phoebe: Radiator.

Ross: Five letters.
Phoebe: Rdtor.
Joey:  Yeah, is Sidney there?  Oh, this is?  Sidney's a woman.
Monica: So she's a woman! So what?

Rachel: Hey. Got a second?
Barry: Sure, sure. Come on...  ...in...
Mindy: Hello, sweetheart.

Barry:  I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
Rachel: Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
Mindy:  You did it twice?

Rachel: Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
Mindy: Okay...
Barry:  Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
Bernice:  Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.

Barry: Oh God...  I'll be right there, Bernice.  Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
Rachel: Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
Mindy: Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.

Joey: All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
Phoebe: You know he's gay?
Ross: I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Danielle:  Chandler?
Chandler: Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
All: Hi. Hi.

Chandler: Okay.
Danielle: G'bye, everybody.
All: Bye.
Phoebe: Whoo-hoo!
Monica: Yeah, there you go!
Ross: Second date!

Joey: How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Monica: I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Rachel: Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.

Monica: I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Ross: I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Chandler: Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.

Monica: That's me.
Phoebe: Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! 
Ross: Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back-  come here, Marcel-
Rachel: Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.

Monica: Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
Ross: What? It's, it's just a phase.
Chandler: Well, that's what we said about Joey...

Rachel: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey.
Monica: Hi.  Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.

Phoebe: What are you doing?
Monica:  Alright, great. Thanks a lot.  I'm going to tap class.
Rachel: What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?

Monica: What d'you think?
Phoebe: Lotsa things.
Rachel: Which one do you think she is?
Teacher: May I help you?

Monica: Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
Teacher: You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.
Rachel: What does she mean?
Phoebe: I think she means  'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon. 

Monica: Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
Teacher:  People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
Rachel: She could be you.

Teacher: Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
Monica: Okay, I'm not getting this!
Phoebe:  I'm totally getting it!

Monica: Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
Rachel: What? You just click when they click.
Teacher: Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
Phoebe: Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.

Monica: Great. It's gym class all over again.
Phoebe and Rachel: Aww.
Teacher: Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.

Monica: Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
Woman: It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?
Teacher: She's your partner.

Woman:  Monana?
Monica: Yeah. It's Dutch.
Fake Monica: You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. 

Ross:  Hi.
Chandler and Joey: Hey.
Joey: Where've you been?

Joey: I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
Chandler: I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
Ross: I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.

Joey: How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
Chandler: I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Ross: Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.

Chandler: What?
Joey: Did you call the cops?
Rachel: Nope. We took her to lunch.

Chandler: Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Ross: What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Monica: Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.

Rachel: No way. No way did you do this.
Fake Monica: Monana was very brave.
Monica: It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!

Fake Monica: So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
Monica: ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Rachel: Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. 

Ross: Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
Rachel: Oh, somebody will.
Joey:  You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Chandler: You're kidding.

Ross: Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Dr. Baldhara: Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
Chandler and Joey: He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
Joey: We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
Chandler: ...He's in.

PA: This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.
Phoebe: Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
Ross: Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.

Phoebe: Oh!
Chandler: Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
Joey: I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Ross: Just, just say what you feel.

Joey: Marcel, I'm hungry.
Ross: That was good.
Rachel:  Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.

Actor:  Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...
Casting Director No. 1: That's fine, thank you.
Casting Director No. 2: Next. 
Joey: Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.

Monica: Tell him.
Rachel: No.
Phoebe: Tell him, tell him.

Monica: Just...please tell him.
Rachel: Shut up!
Chandler: Tell me what?

Monica: Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Chandler:  Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
Rachel: All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
Phoebe: Doing it on this table. 

Chandler: Wow!
Joey: Exellent dream score.
Ross: Why, why, why would you dream that?

Chandler: Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate. 
Rachel: Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
Ross: I love it, when we share.

Chandler: Hello Rachel.
Rachel: Get off.
Phoebe:  Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
Joey: I don't know. What are you wearing?
Ross: Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?

Phoebe: No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
Joey: Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
Chandler:  Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.

Phoebe: I could do that.
Rachel: What are you playing with?
Ross: Oh, it's my new beeper.
Joey: What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
Monica: Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'

Ross: No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
Chandler: A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
Monica: All right, I'll see you guys later. 
Rachel: Off to see young Ethan?

Monica: Okay, he's a senior in college.
Ross: College?
Chandler: Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?

Joey: Hey, hey. How was the first day?
Phoebe: Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
Chandler: See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes.  Me.

Phoebe: You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
Chandler: I don't sound like that.
Ross: Oh, oh Chandler...
Joey: Oh... Yeah, you do.

Ross: 'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
Joey:  My scones.
Phoebe, Joey, and Ross: 'My scones.'
Chandler: Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.

Ross:  Okay, Andr?should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye.  Just easier that way.
Chandler: Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
Rachel: No, forget it.

Chandler: Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
Rachel: All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there.  Joey was there too.
Joey: All right. 
Ross: Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.

Rachel: No, it was just the three of us.
Ross: Huh!
Joey: So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?

Rachel: There were times when it wasn't even me.
Phoebe: That is so sweet, you guys. 
Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe: Hey, Mon.

Rachel: Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
All:  Mon!
Monica: What?

Rachel: Ethan called again.
Monica: Oh.
Ross: Are you not seeing him anymore?

Monica: No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Chandler: And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
Rachel: I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
Joey: Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
Ross: Oh, yeah.

Monica: Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
Joey, Chander, and Ross: Sorry.
Ross: It's morphin time!
Joey: Stegosaurus!
Chandler: Tyrannosaurus!
Phoebe: Ooh, oh, I've gotta go.  Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go.  Cool!
Rachel: Where are you going?

Monica: Aren't you gonna...
Ross: Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
Joey: What about Andr?

Ross: Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
Young Ethan: Hey.
Monica: That was gonna be my opener.
Rachel:  Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?

Ross: I thought that was just a rumour.
Rachel: True story.
Joey: They're here already?
Young Ethan: All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.
Monica: It was.

Gerston: Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger?  Hey, Chandler.
Santos: Hello, Mr. Bing.
Petrie: Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
Chandler: Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.

Santos: Sure.
Gerston: No problem.
Chandler: You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Phoebe: Petrie.

Ross: What is that? 
Joey: For the ride.
Chandler: Yeah, like in a cab...

Ross: I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
Joey: Do we have to know about that?
Monica: Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?

Joey: I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
Chandler: Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
Ross: God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
Rachel: Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.

Rachel: What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
Chandler: You have to pick your moments.
Phoebe: Did I miss it, did I miss it?
Ross: She's not even here yet.
Monica: What's with the guitar?

Phoebe: I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.
Ross:  Where the hell have you been?
Susan: We stopped at the gift shop.
Carol: I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.

Ross: Stopped for a Chunky.
Carol: Let it go, Ross.
Susan: I got an extra one. You want this? 

Ross: Dr. Franzblau, hi.
Dr. Franzblau: So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?
Carol: Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus.
Susan: They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.

Ross: 59 seconds.  Quartz, ha.
Susan: Swiss quartz, ha, ha.
Carol: Am I allowed to drink anything?
Dr. Franzblau: Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station.

Ross: I got itI'm getting it!
Rachel: Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
Carol: Thanks.

Monica: Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
Chandler: Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
Joey:  Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
Lydia: Knick fan?

Phoebe: Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
Monica: No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Chandler: You'll get one.

Monica: Well?
Chandler: Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! 
Rachel: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.

Monica: No, I haven't seen him.
Rachel: Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here.  What if the baby needs him?
Chandler: Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor? 

Ross: Breathe.
Susan: Breathe.
Carol: You're gonna kill me!

Ross: 15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...
Carol: Count faster.
Susan: It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie.

Ross: I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
Susan: No, you don't.
Carol: All right, that's it. I want both of you out.

Ross: No, you started it.
Susan: You did!
Carol: I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.

Nurse: Breathe, breathe, breathe...
Lydia: Oh, no.
Joey: Ew! What is that? Something exploded!

Ross: Oh, I'm threatened by you?
Susan: Yes.
Phoebe: Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!

Monica: Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really.  Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place.  No, he's gone.  No no, you don't have to fly back, really.  What do you mean this might be your only chance?  Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet. 
Chandler: Where have you been?
Joey: Oh, just had a baby.

Carol: Where are they?
Monica: I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Rachel: Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
Joey: Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
Chandler:  You are really frightening me.

Chandler: Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?
Dr. Franzblau: All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
Nurse: All right, honey, time to start pushing.
Carol: But they're not here yet!

Ross: Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
Susan: What do you see?
Phoebe: Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.

All: Push, push!
Ross: We're here!
Carol:  Where have you been?

Ross: Long story, honey.
Dr. Franzblau: All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this?
Nurse: All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
All: Good luck!
Chandler:  Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?

Nurse: Out!
Dr. Franzblau: All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
Ross: Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
Carol:  Not.... helping!

Dr. Franzblau: You're doing great, you're doing fine. 
Ross:  Hello!  Oh, sorry.
Susan: What do you see? What do you see?

Ross: We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
Susan: Oh, look at that.
Carol: What does he look like?

Ross: Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.
Carol: Really?
Phoebe:  You guys, he's beautiful!

Susan: I like Ben.
Carol: Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
Ross: We uh, we just cooked it up.

Susan: That's what we were off doing.
Monica: Hi.
Ross: Hey.

Monica: Can we come in?
Ross:  I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
Phoebe: Susan, he looks just like you.
Susan: Thanks.
Rachel: Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
Chandler: I know, I still am one of these.

Ross: Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.  But I'll still always come back, like this.  And sometimes I may be away longer, like this.  But I'll still always come back, like this.  
Chandler: And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this. 
Monica: He is so amazing.
Rachel: Oh, I know. Look at him.
Joey: Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
Phoebe: Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes.  Look, he's opening his eyes.  

Joey: He doesn't do much, does he?
Ross: No, this is pretty much it.
Rachel: You guys wanna get some coffee?
All: Yeah.

CHANDLER:  No way!
MONICA: I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross! 
PHOEBE: Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?
JOEY: Um, this?

PHOEBE: Yes.
MONICA: Guys, you got your hair cut.
CHANDLER: Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.

PHOEBE: 'Cause, you know,  if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
RACHEL:  Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
CHANDLER: Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.

RACHEL:  You, you, you said he liked me.  You, you slowpokes!
ROSS: That's all right, Rache, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler.  Phoebe.  Joey, what up?  
JOEY: What up?!

ROSS: Everyone, this is Julie.
RACHEL:  Julie.
ALL: Ohh.  Hi!
JULIE: Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.

ROSS: At least.
JULIE:  ...and this guy--
RACHEL: And the chicken poops in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.
MONICA: This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?

JULIE: Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
ROSS: But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig. 
RACHEL: Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
MONICA: It's an expression.

ROSS: Thank you.
CHANDLER: Hey, Rache, can I get--
RACHEL: Did you talk to him?

CHANDLER: Well, you owe me one, big guy.
RACHEL: Here's your lemonade.
ROSS: I didn't order lemonade.

ROSS: Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
MONICA: Phoebes, you know what I'm thinking?
PHOEBE: Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?

MONICA: No you're not.
PHOEBE: I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
JOEY:  Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you. 
ROSS:  Hello? Hi.
CHANDLER:  Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?

JOEY: Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15.  All right, when was 1990?
CHANDLER: You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
ROSS:  Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three.  Well you didn't hang up either. 
RACHEL: She didn't hang up either!

ROSS:  Hi?  Sorry, we got disconnected...
RACHEL: Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
MONICA: Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.

JOEY: You know, I think I was sixteen.
MONICA: Please, just a little bit off the back.
PHOEBE: I'm still on "no".
RACHEL:  Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?

JOEY: No no no no no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.
PHOEBE: What's goin' on?
RACHEL: Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
CHANDLER: What stupid thing did you do?
PAOLO: Bon giorno tutti!

RACHEL: Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
MONICA: Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
CHANDLER: People do stupid things when they're upset.

MONICA: My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't--but this is about your horrible mistake.
ROSS: Hi. Sorry we're late but we were--well, there was touching.
PAOLO: Hey, hey Ross.

ROSS: No, not a problem.
RACHEL: Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
PHOEBE: Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
CHANDLER: Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
JOEY: Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.

CHANDLER: Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
MONICA: You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
PHOEBE: All right. Ok, but, but you have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.

RACHEL: How is she?
PHOEBE: It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
ROSS: How's the hair?

PHOEBE: Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, you come on in. 
JOEY: How're you doing?
RACHEL: I'm ok.

JOEY: Frankie? What're you talking about?
ROSS:  Hey, what's goin' on?
CHANDLER: Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.

ROSS: What?
JOEY: No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
CHANDLER: He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite--

ROSS: what?
CHANDLER: Cupping.
JOEY: That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?

MONICA: Thank you. My hair is very amused.
CHANDLER: Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
PHOEBE: Thank you.
ROSS: Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rache.
RACHEL:  Wait, are you leaving?

ROSS: Okay. 
JOEY: Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
CHANDLER: That's ok.

JULIE: Great! 
PHOEBE:  Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andy McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
RACHEL: No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andy McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.

MONICA:  Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist. 
PHOEBE: Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it.  Oh my god, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
SUSAN: Oh, is he hungry already?
CAROL: I guess so. 
CHANDLER: You know, it's...  something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. 
JOEY:  I gotta get one, too.
ROSS:  What are you guys doing?

CHANDLER: We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
ROSS: Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
JOEY: Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.

ROSS: This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
CHANDLER: Carol, Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
CAROL: Sure.
JOEY: Uh, does it hurt?

CAROL: It did at first, but not anymore.
JOEY: Chandler?
CHANDLER: So, uh, how often can you do it?

JULIE: Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdales who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?
PHOEBE: I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
MONICA: Ok, um, I'll go with you. 

JULIE: Great.
ROSS:  Hi, honey.
CHANDLER: Hey, sweetums.

ROSS: Hello to the rest.
ALL:  Hi!
JOEY: Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
MONICA: It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
CHANDLER: Come on, you're going to Bloomingdales with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.

MONICA: But I'm--
PHOEBE: Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
ROSS: So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?

JOEY: Yeah. Bijan for men?
GUY: No thanks.
TODD: Hombre?

MONICA: You had a salad.
PHOEBE: Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
RACHEL:  Hey, guys, what's up.

JOEY: Bijan for men? Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
ANNABELLE: Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
TODD: Ready, Annabelle?

CAROL: Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
ROSS: Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
SUSAN: Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
RACHEL: Oh, this is so cute.

SUSAN: Oh, I got that for him.
ROSS: My mommies love me. That's clever.
MONICA: Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju-- Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye. 
RACHEL: Did you just say Hi, Jew?

MONICA: Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
PHOEBE: Ben, dinner!
ROSS: Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.

PHOEBE: So?
RACHEL: Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
JOEY: What is the big deal?
CHANDLER: What did you just do?
ROSS: Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?

PHOEBE: Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
ROSS: Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
MONICA: Hey, where is everybody?
RACHEL: They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?

MONICA: Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanna, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
CAROL: How did we do?
PHOEBE: Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
ROSS: I did not freak out. 

CAROL: My breast milk is gross?
SUSAN: This should be fun.
ROSS: No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
CHANDLER: Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.

CAROL: Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
ROSS: That would be no.
PHOEBE: Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
JOEY: Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh--
SUSAN: Cantaloupe juice.

JOEY: Exactly.
ROSS: You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
SUSAN: Uh huh.

ROSS: Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.
CHANDLER: Howdy.
JOEY: Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.

CHANDLER: All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
MONICA: I don't know what else to say.
RACHEL: Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.

MONICA: Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
RACHEL: I love you too.
PHOEBE: You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.

MONICA: I'd do anything for you.
PHOEBE: Wait, wait, wait, wait!
JOEY: Mornin'. I said, mornin'.
TODD: I heard ya.
STORE GUY: All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?

TODD: Ready.
JOEY: Yeah, I'm ready.
CUSTOMER: You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!
STORE GUY: Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?

TODD: I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
ANNABELLE: My god, what happened?
JOEY: These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?

ANNABELLE: Sure.
JULIE: So.
RACHEL: So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?

JULIE: I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
RACHEL: All right, Julie. What a manipulative bitch.
CHANDLER: Hey.
MONICA: So how was Joan?

CHANDLER: I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
MONICA: How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
JOEY: Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.

CHANDLER: You or me?
ROSS: I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
JOEY: You guys are messin' with me, right?
ALL: Yeah.

JOEY: That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
PHOEBE: You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
CHANDLER: Maureen Rosilla.
ROSS: Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
MONICA: Hello, Mr. Heckles.
MR. HECKLES: You're doing it again.

MONICA: We're not doing anything.
MR. HECKLES: You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
RACHEL: You don't have birds.

MR. HECKLES: Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
RACHEL: All right, bye-bye.
CHANDLER: Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
ROSS: We'll give you Janice.
PHOEBE: I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."

RACHEL: "Oh, my, god."
JOEY: "Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
MONICA: Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.

RACHEL: How did this happen?
MR. TREEGER: He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.
MONICA: That's terrible.

MR. TREEGER: You never know.
PHOEBE: Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
CHANDLER: Ok, Phoebe.

PHOEBE: Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
CHANDLER: Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
MR. TREEGER: There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
MONICA: What can we do for you?
MR. BOYLE: All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine".

MONICA: Well, what about his family?
MR. BOYLE: He didn't have any.
RACHEL: Ok, so let's talk money.

MR. BOYLE: All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
MONICA: I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
RACHEL: Have you ever seen so much crap?
CHANDLER: Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
JOEY: Check this out. Can I have this?
ROSS: How can you not believe in evolution?
PHOEBE: Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!

ROSS: Well, there you go.
PHOEBE: Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
CHANDLER: Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
JOEY: Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.

CHANDLER: April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
RACHEL: Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
MONICA: Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.

RACHEL: Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
ROSS: Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
PHOEBE: Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.

ROSS: Is there blood coming out of my ears?
JOEY: Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
CHANDLER: Wow, he looks so normal.
PHOEBE: He's even kind of cute.

JOEY: That's what it says.
CHANDLER: Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
PHOEBE: I'd call that excessive.

CHANDLER:  Hi, it's me.
JANICE: Oh, my, god.
PHOEBE: Janice? You called Janice?

CHANDLER: Oh, my, god!
JOEY: Geez, look how fat she got.
JANICE: Hey, it's everybody.

CHANDLER: You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
JANICE: And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
MONICA: Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
RACHEL: What?

MONICA: Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
RACHEL: Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
PHOEBE: Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
ROSS: Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.

PHOEBE: You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
RACHEL: I am. Let me just get my coat.
MONICA: Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.

RACHEL: Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
MONICA: Phoebe, tell her!
PHOEBE: Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.

RACHEL: Ok, you win.
MONICA: Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
CHANDLER: Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
PHOEBE: Uh huh. Why is that?

CHANDLER: Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
RACHEL: Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
MONICA: You are not a freak. You're a guy.

RACHEL: She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
MONICA: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
CHANDLER: In a bad way?

MONICA: No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
RACHEL: Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
PHOEBE: Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!

MONICA: You made it!
PHOEBE: You're there!
RACHEL: You are ready to make a commitment!
CHANDLER: Whoa! Don't know about that.

RACHEL: Thank you.
MONICA: That's fine.
CHANDLER: Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
JOEY: Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?

CHANDLER: Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
MONICA: Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
RACHEL: It's really not that big!

CHANDLER: Takin' that with you, huh?
JOEY: Oh, yeah.
ROSS: You comin'?

JOEY: This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?
PHOEBE: Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
MONICA: I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.

PHOEBE: I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
MONICA: Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
ROSS: You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.

PHOEBE: OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.
MONICA: Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
ALL: Huuh.

MONICA: What have I not told you?
PHOEBE: Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.
RACHEL: What!

MONICA: Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
PHOEBE: You have a third nipple?
CHANDLER: You bitch.
ROSS: Whip it out, whip it out.

CHANDLER: C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
RACHEL: Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?
JOEY: I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
ROSS: Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?

JOEY: I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.
ALL: Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.
CHANDLER: Joey was in a porno movie.

ALL: Huuh.
CHANDLER: If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
ROSS: You were in a porno?
JOEY: Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
MONICA: That is wild.

ROSS: So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?
CHANDLER: Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
JULIE: You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.

CHANDLER: Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
ROSS: You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
RACHEL: to Monica at the counter Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
MONICA: Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.

RACHEL: Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
ALL: Woah.
JOEY: Foxy lady.
JULIE: Where you goin'?
PHOEBE: Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.

JOEY: The Ice Capades?
CHANDLER: No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
MONICA: I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
PHOEBE: OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
ROSS: holding cream pitcher Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. holds pitcher in front of Chandler's chest and flips the lid Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?

ROSS: OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
JULIE: See you later Rach.
RACHEL: Bye-bye Julie. Julie leaves

ROSS: Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks. hands her a bowl and kisses her
CHANDLER: Uh, Julie.
JULIE: Yeah?

CHANDLER: Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.
ROSS: Hi everyone.
ALL: Hi.

CHANDLER: What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
ROSS: Pop it in.
JOEY: I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people. Chandler puts the tape in
RACHEL: Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.

ROSS: What's wrong with people having sex?
RACHEL: Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
MONICA: Hell, I wanna see Joey.
JULIE: So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.
CHANDLER: OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.

MONICA: All I say is, she better get the job.
ROSS: Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
JOEY: Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, Joey from TV you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.
CHANDLER: Nice work my friend.

MONICA: You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
JULIE: That saves us a conversation.
CHANDLER: Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
JOEY: Me too, we should get goin'.
RACHEL: No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.

MONICA: Rachel, that's all we do.
RACHEL: Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
JULIE: What about Julie?

RACHEL: So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
CHANDLER: I got the time to get to know Julie.
JOEY: I got time.
MONICA: Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? Rachel gives her a look from hell That's fine.

JULIE: No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
RACHEL: Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
CHANDLER: I'm goin' home.

RACHEL: What?
JOEY: Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?
ROSS: Goodnight.

RACHEL: Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?
ROSS: I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
RAHCEL: OK, gook luck.

ROSS: You ever figure out what that thing's for?
CHANDLER: No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned. 
: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
JADE: Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?

CHANDLER: Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
ROSS:  Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
ALL: Hi, Julie!
RACHEL:  Hi, Julie.

CHANDLER: But it's Ross.
PHOEBE: It's Ross.
JOEY: All right.

CHANDLER: You know, I think I might just.
RACHEL: So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
JOEY: Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
PHOEBE: Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?

RACHEL: Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
JOEY: Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". Like we can afford to go here and there.
PHOEBE: Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.

JOEY: For Ross.
RACHEL: For Ross, Ross, Ross.
MONICA:  Oh my god. 

RACHEL: What?
MONICA: I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
JOEY: If it's not you, this is a horrible story.

MONICA: Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
JOEY: Yeah, someplace nice.  How much do you think I can get for my kidney? 
ROSS: I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
CHANDLER: Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.

ROSS: Go.
CHANDLER: Hi. 
JADE: Hi.

CHANDLER: No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
ROSS: Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
MONICA: Who is also in charge of purchasing.

ROSS: Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
MONICA: Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
JOEY: Cool.
PHOEBE: Let's see!

ROSS: That's fine, I'll just wait!
MONICA: Oh, sorry.
JOEY: Sorry, sorry.

ROSS: Monica! 
WAITER: Are we ready to order? 
RACHEL: Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.

WAITER: Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.
PHOEBE: Wow, look at these prices.
RACHEL: Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
JOEY: What are these, like famous chickens?
CHANDLER: Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon.  I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
ROSS: Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?

CHANDLER: Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
ROSS: Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
WAITER: Do I dare ask?
MONICA: Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns. 

ROSS: That sounds great. Same for me.
WAITER: And for the gentleman?
JOEY: Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?

WAITER: And for you?
PHOEBE: Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
CHANDLER: I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.

WAITER: Anything else?
CHANDLER: Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
ROSS:  Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
RACHEL: Um, everyone?

ROSS: So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.
PHOEBE: No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
CHANDLER: Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.

PHOEBE: Not for you.
MONICA: All right, what's goin' on?
RACHEL: Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.

PHOEBE: Fine. All right, fine.
JOEY: Yeah.
CHANDLER: You can tell us. 
ROSS: Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.

JOEY: Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.
MONICA: Ok.
ROSS: I hear ya. 
CHANDLER: We can talk about that.
PHOEBE: Well, then...Let's.

ROSS: That's a good point.
CHANDLER: So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
JOEY: 'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.

ROSS: Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
RACHEL: Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
MONICA: If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.

ROSS: No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.
MONICA: All of us.
CHANDLER: Together.

ROSS: Not at the concert.
RACHEL: Ok.
JOEY: Yeah.

RACHEL: Thank you.
JOEY: Thanks.
PHOEBE: Yeah.
CHANDLER: So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?

CHANDLER: Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
MONICA: I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
PHOEBE: Oh, it's like a skit.

MONICA: Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe. 
ROSS: Whoo!
PHOEBE: Cool.

MONICA: Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
ROSS: But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
CHANDLER: By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.

ROSS: Come on.
CHANDLER: Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
MONICA: It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.
PHOEBE: So...Thank you.

ROSS: Could you be less enthused?
JOEY: Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--
MONICA: Like?

JOEY: Charity.
MONICA: Charity?
ROSS: We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
RACHEL: Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
PHOEBE: Actually, it makes us feel that big.

ROSS: I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
CHANDLER: If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
JOEY: Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
RACHEL: Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
PHOEBE: I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.

RACHEL: Me neither.
JOEY: Me too.
MONICA: Guys, we bought the tickets.
PHOEBE: Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
CHANDLER: Why did you look at me when you said that?

MONICA: You know what? You're right.
PHOEBE: Fine.
ROSS: Fine.
JOEY: Fine.
CHANDLER: Fine.
RACHEL: Fine.

MONICA: All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
ROSS: Chandler! 
CHANDLER: Yeah?

ROSS: Still doing the screening thing?
CHANDLER: I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
MACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
JADE: Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.

CHANDLER: Well, that makes me feel so good.
JADE: It was just so awkward and bumpy.
ROSS:  Bumpy?

CHANDLER: Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
JADE: Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
MONICA: You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
ROSS: Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.

CHANDLER: Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
MONICA: You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
JOEY: Come on you guys, one more time.
PHOEBE: Ok. One.

JOEY: Nooo.
MONICA: That was amazing!
ROSS: Excellent, that was excellent.
CHANDLER: I can't believe the guys missed this.

ROSS: What guys? Oh, yeah.
STEVE: Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?
MONICA: Do I know you?

STEVE: Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
ROSS: Ross.
CHANDLER: Chandler.

STEVE: How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
ROSS: Hey, you guys.
RACHEL: Happy birthday.

ROSS: Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
RACHEL: Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
MONICA: Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?

RACHEL: Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
MONICA: Uh, good.
ROSS: Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
CHANDLER: Yeah, we really missed you guys.
JOEY: Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
PHOEBE: We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?

MONICA: You know, a party, or--
RACHEL: What party?
ROSS: It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
JOEY: You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
CHANDLER: Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.

RACHEL: Oh!
PHOEBE: Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
ROSS: Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.

RACHEL: What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
MONICA: It's work.
CHANDLER: I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it. 
JOEY: And we don't work hard?

MONICA:  Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
CHANDLER: I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
JOEY: And you feel like we hold you back.

MONICA: Maye it's me.
ROSS: Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
CHANDLER: You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.

ROSS: There we go. All better. 
MONICA: There's my little boy. 
CHANDLER: Can I uh see something? 
JOEY: Cool.

MONICA: What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
CHANDLER: Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.
JOEY: Goo, goo, goo, waaah!

MONICA: That is so funny. Let me see that. 
JOEY: Are you ok, Ross?
ROSS: I don't know. What's in this pie? 

MONICA: Jacket now.
ROSS: What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
CHANDLER: We'll watch him.

ROSS: I don't think tho.
JOEY: What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
CHANDLER: I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.

ROSS: ???  Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!
JOEY: Consider it done.
CHANDLER: You understood that?

JOEY: Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
CHANDLER: Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
PHOEBE: Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
RACHEL: Ok.

PHOEBE:  I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.
TERRY: Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
RACHEL: What's up?

TERRY: Uh--
RACHEL: Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
PHOEBE:  Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
CHANDLER: You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
JOEY: It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.

CHANDLER: Oh, seriously you want him?
CAROLINE: Hello.
BOYS: Hello.

CAROLINE: And who is this little cutie pie?
CHANDLER: Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
JOEY: You wanna smell him?

CAROLINE: You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?
PHOEBE: But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.
RACHEL: Honey, I'm sorry.

PHOEBE: Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could. 
RACHEL: Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.
TERRY: I, I don't know. 

RACHEL: Well, but Pheebs.
PHOEBE: No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play.  When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity.  Thank you! La la la la la la la....
ROSS: Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun. 
DOCTOR: Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
MONICA: Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.

ROSS: Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
MONICA: My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally. 
DOCTOR: No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.

ROSS: Ok.
MONICA: Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
CHANDLER: That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
JOEY: Hey, hey, look at that talent.

CHANDLER: Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
GIRL 2 ON BUS: So what are you guys out doing today?
JOEY: Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.

CHANDLER: You done?
JOEY: Yeah.
GIRL 1: Oh, there's our stop.

JOEY: Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
GIRL 1: So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?
CHANDLER: Oh, sure, they love us over there.
GIRL 2: Where's your baby?
CHANDLER AND JOEY:  Ben! Ben! Ben! 

CHANDLER: Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
BOTH: Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait! 
MONICA: Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.
DOCTOR: No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring.
ROSS: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate. 
PHOEBE:  ... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?
STEPHANIE: Yeah. I'm Stephanie.

PHOEBE: Oh. Mine does.  Stephanie knows all the chords. 
CHANDLER:  Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
JOEY: Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
RACHEL: Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--

PHOEBE:  Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
RACHEL: Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.
STEPHANIE: Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved.  Zachary.

PHOEBE:  You're all invited to bite me!
CHANDLER AND JOEY: Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
TRANSIT AUTHORITY GUY: He's here.  I'm assuming one of you is the father.
CHANDLER: That's me.
JOEY: I'm him.

CHANDLER: What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
RACHEL: Hey.
PHOEBE: Oh, hi.

RACHEL: Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
KID: Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.
PHOEBE: Yeah. Here you go.

KID: Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!
ROSS: I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.

ROSS: Hi.
PHOE: Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?

ROSS: Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing?

JOEY: Hey, here's a thought, Ross. reaches for the computer

CHAN: No, Amish boy.
JOEY: Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
ROSS: I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.

JOEY: You could say that.
ROSS: And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
CHAN: Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?

ROSS: I don't know.
JOEY: Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
CHAN: Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?

CHAN: I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
JOEY: to Ross Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?

RACH: Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
ROSS: He won't? remembers what it is He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
CHAN: Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.

RACH: Come on.
JOEY: Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
CHAN: through gritted teeth Alright. clears his throat "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
ROSS: That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.

RACH: What is this? Ross, what is this?
CHAN: Good luck.
ROSS: Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?

CHAN: My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
MNCA: You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
PHOE: I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
JOEY: Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.

PHOE: What?
MNCA: What?
CHAN: Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.

MNCA: This was your idea?
PHOE: What were you thinking?

MONICA: Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.

CHANDLER: And twenty-five it is.
JOEY: You gave him cookies?
MONICA: Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
PHOEBE: I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.

CHANDLER: Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?

CHANDLER: And last but not least.
JOEY: They're ribbed for your pleasure.
RACH: Joey, would you slow down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.

JOEY: I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.
MNCA: You were so amazing as the king. I was really impressed, I was.
PHOE: Although, you know what? You might want to consider wearing underwear next time. Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject.

JOEY: Here it is, here it is. reading from newspaper The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.
CHAN: OK, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright. Phoebs, read yours.
PHOE: OK. reading The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...

CHAN: Does anyone have one from a different paper? Ross, read yours.
ROSS: I don't want to.
RACH: Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.

MNCA: But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.

RACH: Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
ROSS: to Russ For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
RUSS: You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.

MNCA: Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
ROSS: Ooooohhhh.
PHOE: What's with all the bottles of liquor?

ROSS: What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
MNCA: Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
RACH: Oh God, even his knock is boring.

MNCA: Take care.
FBOB: You too.
RACH: What happened?

MNCA: holding bottles Does anybody want these?
CHAN: I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.

CHAN: Oh, hey.
PHOE: Hi.

RUSS: Oh.
JULIE: Hey.

CAROL: So how did everything go?

ROSS: Ok.
SUSAN: clears her throat
CAROL: Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.

ROSS: Oh, you and me?
CAROL: Uh, no, Susan and me.
SUSAN: The other us.

ROSS: This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
JOEY: It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
MONICA: Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
ROSS, CHANDLER  JOEY: Yes!

MONICA: Oh, you are so great! kisses him Thank you!
JOEY: Are you really not going?
ROSS: I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?

MONICA: They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
ROSS: If you wanna call that a reason.
CHANDLER: singing to the tune of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.

MONICA: Ross, I thought you were over this.
ROSS: Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
JOEY: Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
RACHEL: entering hurriedly Did I miss it? Did I miss it?

JOEY: Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
RACHEL: I'm sorry, what?
MONICA: What?

MRS. WALLACE: Is she gonna be all right?
JOEY: I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
CHANDLER: Nice!
RACHEL: That's great!
ROSS: Excellent!

CHANDLER: For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
ROSS: That is so good! Do it again!
JOEY: All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"

CHANDLER: Oh, yeah. 
ROSS: Oh, hello.
PHOEBE: Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...

ROSS: Oh my god.
CHANDLER: That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
PHOEBE: Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
MONICA: Oh, honey.

PHOEBE: I think it went into me.
MONICA: God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
CHANDLER: Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
RACHEL: Ok, who ordered what?
ROSS: Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.

CHANDLER: Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
RACHEL: Oh god.
JOEY: I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.

RACHEL: I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
PHOEBE: Mrs. Adelman's voice Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
JOEY: Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?

PHOEBE: I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Mrs. Adelman's voice Sit up!
MRS. GREEN: entering There she is.
RACHEL: Mom!
MRS GREEN: Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.

RACHEL: This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.
MRS GREEN: Oh hello, Ross. 
ROSS: Hi, Mrs. Green. He gets up to shake her hand, but she ignores him.

MRS GREEN: Yes.
PHOEBE: I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
JOEY: Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?

PHOEBE: I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
MRS GREEN: Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.
RACHEL: Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.

MRS GREEN: I'm uh, considering leaving your father.
MONICA: entering All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
RACHEL: Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.

MONICA: Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
ROSS: And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
RACHEL: None.
JOEY: They didn't fight a lot?

RACHEL: No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
PHOEBE: Mrs. Adelman's voice In my day, divorce was not an option.
JOEY: Hey, look who's up.

RACHEL: Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
CHANDLER: You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
PHOEBE: That's him.

CHANDLER: Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
MR A: Phoebe?
PHOEBE: Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.

MR A: to Joey Worth a shot, huh?
MRS GREEN: Look at this.
RACHEL: These are from Halloween three years ago.

MRS GREEN: Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?
RACHEL: No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
MONICA: Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?

RACHEL: Hey, Mon, you want some help?
MONICA: If you want.
PHOEBE: enters Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.

RACHEL: She's still with you?
PHOEBE: Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Takes Mrs. Green's chin in her hand and says, in Mrs. Adelman's voice Oh, such a pretty face.
MRS GREEN: This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?

RACHEL: God!
MONICA: All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food. 
MRS GREEN: That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?

RACHEL: Oh! What's new in sex?
MRS GREEN: The only man I've ever been with is your father.
MONICA: I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.

MRS GREEN: You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
RACHEL: Oh.
MONICA: All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
CHANDLER: Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.

MONICA: Joey, speed it up!
JOEY: I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
PHOEBE: Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.

MONICA: It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.everyone groans
CAROL: Fine, whatever.
ROSS: What's the matter?

CAROL: Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
ROSS: What?
MONICA: You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.

ROSS: Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
CAROL: You're right. Of course you're right.
MONICA: So we're back on?

CAROL: We're back on.
MONICA: You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
JOEY: It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
CHANDLER: Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
PHOEBE: Mrs. Adelman's voice Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.

CAROL: Ross. He lets her go
MINISTER: You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.
PHOEBE: Mrs. Adelman's voice Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Phoebe's voice Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.
MONICA: Would you look at them?
ROSS: Yeah, can't help but.
JOEY: to a wedding guest How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? the guy nods I wrapped those bad boys.

PHOEBE: Ok, that's so nice.
CHANDLER: to an attractive woman I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? The woman walks away
RACHEL: Hey, Mom? Having fun?
MRS GREEN: Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.

RACHEL: There's more alcohol, right?
SUSAN: How you doin'?
ROSS: Ok.

SUSAN: Come on. I'll let you lead.
ROSS: Ok.
CHANDLER: to the woman who just rejected him All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people. She walks away again.
MONICA: Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?

COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER: ...With MonkeyShine Beer. MonkeyShine theme MonkeyShine Beer, 'cause it's a jungle out there.
ROSS: That commercial always makes me so sad.
JOEY: Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.

ROSS: I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
PHOEBE: I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
MONICA: And the fact that they're both monkeys.

JOEY: No, my first fan mail.
ALL: Alright!
MONICA: reading 'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
RACHEL: Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.

MONICA: This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
JOEY: Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.
ROSS: Hey guys.
ALL: Hey.
PHOEBE: Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?

ROSS: Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
CHANDLER: You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
RACHEL: Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
PHOEBE: Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.

CHANDLER: Hello.
ERICA: It's Erica.
JOEY: Ah, the stalker.

ERICA: Never mind, it's open.
CHANDLER: Joey grabs a frying pan Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
JOEY: Let's get out of here.

CHANDLER: That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
JOEY: She's comin'.
ERICA: It's me.

JOEY: Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
CHANDLER: Wait, wait, wait. Opens the top of the dish soap he's holding
ERICA: Hi.

KIDS: Ooohhh.
PHOEBE: I know.
MONICA: I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
CHANDLER: Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?
RACHEL AND MONICA: Yeah.

CHANDLER: Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
RACHEL: Oh my God.
MONICA: Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.

CHANDLER: Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
ROB: You OK?
PHOEBE: No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.

ROB: That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
PHOEBE: I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?
ROSS: I was thinkin' about it.

ERICA: No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?
JOEY: Alright, just one. she licks his hands rather emphatically Wow, you're good at that.
WAITER: Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?

PHOEBE: singing There'll be times when you get older
MONICA: Excellent!
CHANDLER: Very informative!
RACHEL: Not at all inappropriate!

ROSS: Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
CHANDLER: That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
PHOEBE: OK, hi again.
ALL: Hi Phoebe.

TV DOCTOR: You're the only one who can save her Drake.
JOEY ON TV: Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
ROSS: Well, there goes my whole belief system.
ERICA: It's Erica.
JOEY: Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
RACHEL: No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.

JOEY: Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
RACHEL: Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
MONICA: Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.

JOEY: Somebody wanna help me out here?
RACHEL: Oh, I know, I know. Turns on the TV. Joey in on it.
ERICA: How, how can you be here and there.

JOEY: I'm not Drake.
ROSS: That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
ERICA: Is this true?
RACHEL: Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me. throws water in his face

PHOEBE: OK, Rachel, I'm ready.
RACHEL: OK.
KID: Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?

ROSS: This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
CHANDLER: What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
SECURITY GUARD: C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

ROSS: Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.

ROSS: I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.
TRAINER: Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all.

TRAINER: In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.
ALL: Woah.
CHANDLER: to guys wering yellow isolation suits So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set?

SUSIE: We've got a problem.
DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: Tell me.

SUSIE: Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
CHANDLER: Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
MONICA: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
RACHEL: What what what what?

MONICA: Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.
RACHEL: Excuse me. Hi.
VAN DAMME: Hi.

RACHEL: I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?
VAN DAMME: You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
CHANDLER: No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
SUSIE: OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?

CHANDLER: No one was around to hear that?
MONICA: So what'd he say?
RACHEL: Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.

RACHEL: That is so unfair.
PHOEBE: I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
ROSS: Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.
JOEY: You're blowin' me off for a monkey?

PHOEBE: Stick a fork what?

PHOEBE: Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...
MONICA: Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.

PHOEBE: OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
MONICA AND RACHEL: Ow. Ow. Ow.

PHOEBE: Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
RACHEL: Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
MONICA: Uh-huh.

ROSS: Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.
JOEY: Forget about it.
SUSIE: How you doin there squirmy?
CHANDLER: I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.

JOEY: So what're you guys gonna eat?
SUSIE: How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?
CHANDLER: Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.

MONICA: You don't have the guts.
RACHEL: Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.
PHOEBE: Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place?

PHOEBE: Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.
MONICA: I'll help you fix your sweater.
RACHEL: I'll help you throw out your purse.

JOEY: Chandler's wearing panties.
ROSS: What? Let me see. climbs up in the other adjoining stall
CHANDLER: No, no, you don't have to see.

ROSS: Hi Tushie.
CHANDLER: Alright, one of you give me your underpants.
JOEY: Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.

VAN DAMME: Goodbye.
MONICA: Well, bye for me too. kisses him
RACHEL: OK, well, bye-bye again. kisses him again

MONICA: OK.
VAN DAMME: Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could. . .
MONICA AND RACHEL: Oh, no no no no no.

VAN DAMME: Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt.
MONICA AND RACHEL: No no no no.
RACHEL: Impressive.
MONICA: But no. Maybe if I were baking.

ROSS: Bye Marcel. See ya on the big screen. You keep people drinkin' that beer, OK. I miss you buddy.

RACHEL: Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.
PHOEBE: I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
ROSS: Hey you guys.

MONICA: Ok. Richard walks in Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
JOEY: Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?

RICHARD: Glad to be of help. Matches. walks out to the balcony
MONICA: I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?

ROSS: Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.
CAROL: Uhh, we know, he already did it last week.
SUSAN: You can watch our tape if you want. 

PHOEBE: Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.
CHANDLER: Hey.
JOEY: Hey.
RACHEL: Hey.
MONICA: Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?

ROSS: Buy mommy.
CAROL and SUSAN: We love you. Buy.

ROSS: Yeah.
MONICA: Look. they look at Joey in the kitchen with a cigar in his mouth, looking at his reflection in a spatula Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
JOEY: How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?

ROSS: Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
MONICA: You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
JOEY: Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.

ROSS: Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
CHANDLER: Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
MONICA: So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?
JOEY: Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.

ROSS: Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
CHANDLER: Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
MONICA: You're meeting Richard?
JOEY: Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.

MONICA: Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.

RICHARD: Ok. leaves
MONICA: Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
PHOEBE: Sure.

MONICA: It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
PHOEBE: Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.
RACHEL: enters Aghh.

PHOEBE: Me too. leaves
MONICA: I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
RACHEL: Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.

MONICA: Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
ROSS: enters Ok, what the hell happened back there?
RACHEL: I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.

CHANDLER: Kick save and... denied.
RICHARD: But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?
JOEY: Man you are incredible.

RICHARD: Ok, just one more point.
MONICA: grabs the other two bars on Richard's side and scores Score! Now can we go?
CHANDLER: See, that's why we don't let her play.

RICHARD: Uh-oh.
CHANDLER: Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.

RICHARD: Uh, you guys see me as a dad?
JOEY: Oh yeah.
CHANDLER: No.

JOEY: Nooooo.
CHANDLER: Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
RICHARD: Uh-huh, yeah.

CHANDLER: No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
RICHARD: That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around.

CAROL: We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting.

JOEY: Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
MONICA: 'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
RACHEL: Ok honey, you really need a job.
ROSS: Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.

MONICA: Really.
PHOEBE: Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.
ROSS: On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.

PHOEBE: No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
ROSS: Freakish.
MONICA: Wow.
JOEY: Freaky.

MONICA: Weird, weird.
RACHEL: Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?

I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb.

RACHEL: Look at her.
CHANDLER: Hi Monica.
JOEY: He-he-he, how's it goin'?
PHOEBE: Hey nice boobs.

MONICA: You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
ROSS: Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
JOEY: Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?

ROSS: Yeah.
PHOEBE: Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
MONICA: Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.

ROSS: I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
MONICA: Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
JOEY: Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
PHOEBE: Why not her?

JOEY: Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
CHANDLER: Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
MONICA: Joey that is horriable.

JOEY: I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
ROSS: Hi honey, how did it go?
RACHEL: Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
CHANDLER: Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.

RACHEL: My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
PHOEBE: Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
MONICA: Well, how bout just her mom?
CHANDLER: Why her mom?

PHOEBE: Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
MONICA: Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
CHANDLER: Excuse me?

MONICA: No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
MR. GREENE: I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?

MRS. GREENE: Well, my goodness, what was that?

MONICA: Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
MRS. GREENE: You thought I was Rachel?
CHANDLER: Yes because uh, you look so young.

MONICA: Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
ROSS: Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?
MR. GREENE: It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.

ROSS: I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.

JOEY: Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him 
ALL: Bye.
PHOEBE: Bye, good luck.

PHOEBE: We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
JOEY: Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.
CHANDLER: How do you not fall down more?

CHANDLER: What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.

MONICA: You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.
BEST MAN:  Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you.  I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...

Phoebe: Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.
Chandler:  All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men.  Get up.
Joey: What?

Chandler: The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
Joey: Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there  . Soo...
Ross: You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..

Chandler: All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal.  GET UP!!
Monica:  Hi.
All: Hey.

Monica: Hang on a second I just got in.
Ross: Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late.

Ross: Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
Monica: Has somebody been drinking my fat?  
Rachel:  You guys,  does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
Phoebe: I don't know, you might be the first one.

Monica: Rach, did you check the machine?
Rachel: Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
Chandler: Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called: Get Up.
Joey: All right! You can have the chair.

Chandler: Really!
Joey: Oh my, would you look at that!  
Phoebe:  "Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?"  Is that too spooky?
Ross:  "Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
Rachel:  What?!

Ross: Nevermind.
Richard:  "Monica, it's Richard. Call me."
Monica: Is-is-is that message old or new?  Old or new?! Old or new?!

Ross: It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
Monica: What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Chandler: Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.

Ross: I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay.  There we go, there we go.
Chandler: You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here.  Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!  
Phoebe: Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
Chandler and Joey: Sorry Phoebe.
Joey: I'm so sorry.

Phoebe: Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
Chandler: Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
Monica: So, should I call him back?
The Guys: Noo!  NO!

Chandler: All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!  
Rachel:  Is this a little too...  Pheebs, what happened?
Phoebe: Hummus. I got the hummus.

Rachel: Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
Monica: I called him.
All: Nooo.

Monica: I know the code to his answering machine.
Ross: Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.
Richard:  "Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone."
Machine: "You have two new messages."
Joey: Wow, what a cool job.  'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'

Monica:  "Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
Joey: Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
Woman's Voice:  Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.

Monica: It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
Rachel: Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
Ross: You don't, you don't know what your wearing?

Rachel: Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Ross: Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
Chandler: All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
Joey: Okay.  

Chandler: Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
Ross: Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
Rachel: Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.

Ross: Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Rachel: Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
Phoebe: Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me!  

Rachel: Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
Phoebe: Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!
Ross: Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?

Rachel: No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
Chandler: We used them as pillows when we went camping.
Ross: What?

Chandler:  The sheep.
Ross: Hey, what you do on your own time...
Joey:  Where's my underwear?!

Ross: Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
Joey: It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Chandler: Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.

Joey: Hey, opposite, is opposite!  
Chandler: He's got nothing!
Phoebe:  Okay, I'm ready.
Ross and Chandler: Oh, aaaah!

Phoebe: Duh!! Christmas!
Ross: Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch.  Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more.  What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!
Rachel:  Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?

Ross: Just, just, just pick one!
Phoebe: Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
Rachel: Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?

Ross: It was, it was her voice.
Chandler: Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
Michelle: Hola! Hello. Hello?
Monica: Okay. That was her right?
Phoebe: Definitely.

Monica: See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
Ross: Yay!
Phoebe: I'll get it, okay.  Hi, Monica and Rachel's.  Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling.  Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that. 

Monica: Okay, fine.  
Chandler: They got a phone in there, right?
Phoebe: Okay, we're on it. We're on it.
Ross: Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
Rachel: I'm not gonna gooo.

Ross: I love you.  
Phoebe:  Get away from that! No!  She's just getting dressed.
Chandler: Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Joey: Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.

Chandler: Oooo-ooh!
Joey: Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.  
Ross: Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!

Chandler: Jeez, what a baby.
Joey: Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
Ross: You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.

Joey: You could drink the fat.
Ross: Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
Rachel: No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.

Ross: What?
Rachel: I think you should drink the fat.
Joey: Yaaaay!

Ross: Well, yeah.
Rachel: You were gonna drink the fat.
Joey: Let's see what else he'll do!

Ross:  How 'bout instead you, go get changed!  You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica! 
Chandler: Stop it. Stop it!
Phoebe: Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
Richard:  Hi, this is Richard.
Machine: You have three new messages.
Monica: Not any more!

Monica: Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number. 
Phoebe: Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
Ross: Rachel!!  Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
Rachel: And I still have about five seconds to spare.  Okay, that was about seven seconds.

Sherman Whitfield: Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.
Ross: Wow! What a pleasure.
Whitfield:  Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written.
Chandler: Excuse me. Hi.

Monica: Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Rachel: I didn't know there were docks.
Joey: Hey.
Chandler: Hey.
Ross: Aww, is it broken?

Joey: Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
Chandler: Because the kids need new shoes.
Monica: I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam.  Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.  

Rachel: Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about.  Hey.
Ross: Hey.
Chandler: Do I look fat?
Ross and Rachel: Noo.

Chandler: Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
Rachel: Nooo!

Ross: And it works both ways.
Chandler: Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
Rachel: Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.

Ross:  Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Chandler: Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
Rachel: Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers.  Okay, I'm late for work.

Ross: Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
Rachel: Good luck Chandler.
Chandler: Thank you Rachel.

Joey: Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
Rachel:  You're so pretty.

Rachel: Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Monica: I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
Chandler: Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
Ross: What are you talking about?

Monica: I'm talking about me having a baby.
Ross: What?
Rachel: Are you serious?

Chandler: You mean there's more than one of us.
Ross: Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
Monica: You're gonna what?

Ross:  Oh, it's not the ideal way...
Monica: Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
Joey: Check it out!! Jam crackers!

Monica: Joey, this is you!
Joey: Let me see.  Oh, right.
Rachel: When did you go to a sperm bank?

Joey: Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
Phoebe:  Hellooo!

Joey: You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
All: Shhhh!

Host: Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
Joey:  Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Mike: And there is Kevin.

Joey: Can we please turn this off?
Rachel: Noo way, Kevin.
Mike: There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
Ross:  Are you intrigued?
Chandler: You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!

Chandler: Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Janice: Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.  
Monica: Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this,  so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Joey:  Hey!
Phoebe: Hey.

Chandler: Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
Phoebe: Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me! 
Joey: How is it you?

Phoebe: Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.  
Joey: Yep, that's my audition.
Monica: See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.

Phoebe: Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.
Janice: What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
Joey: Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.

Carol and Susan:  Hey!!
Ross: There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi  What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
Carol: He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.
Susan: He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.

Ross: Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
Susan: So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.
Carol: This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?

Ross: Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck?  No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?  
Rachel: Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?  
Monica:  I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
Joey: I love that movie.  

Monica: There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
Joey: I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
Chandler:  Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.

Joey: Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
Chandler: Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight.  Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Rachel: What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?

Chandler: No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
Rachel: Men are unbelievable.
Monica: What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?

Chandler: I know, that,  that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
Monica: Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
Joey: Hey, you know about that?!

Chandler: Do we have any...  Do we have any thoughts here?
Joey: Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
Rachel: Amazingly, that makes sense.

Phoebe: Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Rachel: Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
Joey: Come on baby, come on!

Phoebe:  'Okay, go ahead.'  Um, hi Annie.  Fantastic!  You got it.  Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that,  except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next....  Op, went through a tunnel.
Rachel: Unbelievable.
Joey: Thank you so much.

Rachel: Honey, this will help.  
Chandler: So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Rachel and Monica: Uff.
Monica: That is never good.

Chandler: This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Rachel: Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
Monica: You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.

Rachel: Yeah, you do.
Chandler: So, you don't think I'm terminal?
Monica: Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.

Chandler: Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
Rachel and Monica: Nooo!
Rachel: This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
Monica: She has to know that your not ready.

Ross: Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.  'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
Rachel:G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
Joey:  G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?

Ross: Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
Joey and Ross: Go Joe!!!
Phoebe:  Helloo! Oh!  
Joey: Pheebs! There you are!

Chandler: I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
Rachel: Yeah, it is.
Monica: You know what, everything's gonna be okay. 

Chandler:  Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay.  Okay, what do I do?
Rachel: Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
Monica: If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.

Rachel: Yeah.
Chandler: Hello!
Monica: Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.

Carol:G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
Ross: Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
Susan: What'd you do, dip it in sugar?

Ross:  Oh God.
Susan: I've literally never been this happy.
Monica: Wasn't there a little song?
Carol: Oh please God, let there be a song.

Chandler: Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
Ross: Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
Monica: So, Chandler, who's on your list?

Chandler: I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
Joey: Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
Monica: First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.

Joey: It's just a game Mon.  Rach, how about you?
Rachel: Oh, I don't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.
Ross: Spiderman?

Rachel: Hardy Boy.
Chandler: Peter Parker.
Ross: Thank you.

Rachel: What about you honey, who would be on your list?
Ross: Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
Chandler:  What a geek!
Phoebe:  Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
All: Oh, hi.

Phoebe: This is everybody. This is Ross.
Frank: How are you?
Ross: Hey.

Phoebe: Chandler.
Chandler: Hi.
Frank: Hi.

Phoebe: Joey.
Joey: Hey-hey!
Frank: Hey.

Phoebe: And this is Rachel.
Rachel: Hi!
Frank: Whoa!!

Phoebe: I'm gonna get coffee.
Frank: Hey, how do you guys get anything done?
Chandler: We don't, really.
Rachel: Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?

Ross: And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Chandler: Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
Rachel: So?

Monica: No, that is what the game is.
Phoebe: Which you just gave up really quickly.
Chandler:  Have you seen Joey?

Monica: What's the matter?
Chandler: Oh, just this!  Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
Joey:  Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.

Monica: It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was.  Whoa! Are you going in there for?
Chandler: What, like a number?
Ross:  Hey! 

Chandler: Hi! Bye!  
Ross: Okay, I'm done with my choices, these are final.  
Rachel: Well, it's about time.
Joey: Ooh, very official.

Frank: So wait, what's the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I can't touch you?
Phoebe and Girl: Ewww!!!
Phoebe: You can't have sex with her!
Girl: What'd you think I was, a hooker?

Frank: No, your a masseuse, it's cool, I'm not a cop.
Phoebe: Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
Jasmine: Fine.  I don't like you!!  

Chandler: Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk.
Rachel: Oh!
Joey: All right, but in the future...
Ross: Okay!! Okay!!

Rachel: Come on!
Ross: Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
Chandler: Okay, one...two...
Joey: So we are going on two?
All: All right!!  

Chandler: Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller! 
Joey: Maybe, my ruler's wrong.
Phoebe: Maybe all the rulers are wrong.

Rachel: Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right?  Okay, great.  You freak.
Ross:  Thank you.
Isabella:  Um, coffee to go, please.

Ross: Okay, hold my crawler.
Rachel: Okay.
Monica: Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?

Rachel: Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.
Ross:  Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee?  Or maybe reimburse you for that one? 
Isabella: Aren't you with that girl over there?  

Janice: Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?
Phoebe: Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.
Ross: I'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.

Janice: I'm sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
Joey: Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
Monica and Rachel: What?!!
Rachel: Excuse me, there was no time!

Joey: Okay, but let's say there was. How might that go?
Janice: Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?
Rachel: Does anybody need more coffee?
Ross: Yeah, I'll take some.

Phoebe: Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
Chandler:  Hey.
Ross: Hey.

Chandler: Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'
Monica:  Ross  , foot on the floor or come over no more!
Ross:  Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.

Monica: What?
Ross: I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
Chandler: Umm, how's it going with you guys?

Chandler: Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
Rachel:   Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don't think this is.
Waitress: I am so sorry.

Rachel: Oh, I don't know. Well maybe it's just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don't know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system.  
Friend No. 1: Rachel stop!
Friend No. 2: You're so bad!

Rachel: Yeah, so?
Chandler:  And now I've picked it up again.  
Monica: Oh my God, I went to high school with her.  Rachel! Hi!

Ross: I don't know, something girlie.
Phoebe:  Hey, you're early.
Monica: What are you doing with the lamp?

Phoebe: Then I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.  
Mr. Heckles:  Who are you?
Eric: Hi, I'm Eric, I'm gonna be Chandler's new roommate.

Monica: Hi, again.
Joey: Hey!  
Chandler:  Hey!

Ross: Huh?  
Phoebe: Oh, Ross you're right, I don't know why I always thought this was real grass.
Monica: Hey, are you okay?

Ross: My wife's a lesbian.
Joey: Cool!!
Chandler: Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross.  

Chandler: I can't believe you came back.
Rachel: Don't say anything. I don't wanna speak, I don't wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
Friend No. 2: Rachel! Rachel!  

Ross: Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
Monica: I was always Joanne.
Joey: Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?
Phoebe: Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!

Joey: Booo!!
Chandler:  Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Janice: Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
Matress King:  'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices!

Rachel: But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do.  All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
Chandler:  I'll go.
Ross: Fine.

Rachel: Thank you.
Ross: Hi Gunther.
Gunther: Yeah, we'll see!
Joey:  Hey, you guys!
Phoebe: Hey!

Joey: I got a gig!
All: Yay!!
Chandler: See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig.
Phoebe: Yeah, I can't say croissant.  Oh my God!
Monica: What's the part?

Joey: Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
Ross: Come on! That's great.
All: Wow!

Joey: Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin.
Phoebe: Oh.  
Guy: Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King.  You Miss Geller?

Joey: All right. I can't see.
Phoebe: All right, I have ya. Oh God.
Guy: Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?

Rachel: You remember Ross.
Dr. Green: Um-hmm.
Ross: Nice to see you again Dr. Green. 

Dr. Green: You know what's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.
Ross: Yeah, if you're really hungry.  It was a joke, I made a joke.
Rachel: Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.

Ross: Wow. I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that.  
Dr. Green: Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go.
Rachel: Okay.

Ross: You really serve people sneezers?
Rachel: Well um, I don't.
Dr Green: You kids ready?

Dr. Green:  What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
Ross: Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really.
Rachel: Yeah it is, it is.  We really, really have to do something about that.

Ross: I know.
Dr. Green: Excuse me, you think I'm cheap?
Rachel: Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.

Ross: Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
Phoebe: I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
Rachel: Um. yeah.

Phoebe: I am soo dead.  
Rachel: All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
Ross: Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.

Monica:  Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed.
Chandler: Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want..  Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
Phoebe: It's Monica's bed. What?

Rachel:  Hi Daddy.
Dr. Green: Baby. Ross.
Ross: Dr. Green. How are you?  

Dr. Green: Nice hair. What'd ya do? Swim here?
Ross:  Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore.
Rachel: What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.

Ross: Look, look I'm sorry. It's just that....
Dr. Green: Ross? What's with the neck?
Rachel: He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...

Dr. Green: You're still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn't get into medical school in Extapa!
Ross: Thank you! That's what I keep saying.
Rachel: Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.

Ross: Uh.
Dr. Green: Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?
Rachel: Well that's his last name.

Ross: And his first name.
Dr. Green: He's Bobby Bobby?
Rachel: It's Robert Bobby.

Dr. Green: Oh.
Rachel: And um, excuse me, he helps me.
Ross: Oh-ho please. Ask her how?

Dr. Green: Oh God!
Ross: Argue with that.
Rachel: What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter.

Dr. Green: So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?
Rachel: I'm sorry, let her?
Ross: What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either.

Dr. Green: I'd love some juice. Thanks.
Ross: Okay.  Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
Rachel: Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.

Chandler: Okay, I'm not gonna have one.
Ross: Neither will I.  
Phoebe: No, no, it's just my tooth.

Chandler: All right I'll have one.  
Ross: So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
Phoebe: No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.

Chandler: See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Ross: Why? Why can't you go to him?
Phoebe: Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.

Chandler: That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
Rachel: Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
Phoebe: Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.

Rachel: And all these people actually died?
Phoebe: Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Ross: Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.

Ross: Thanks, Gunther.   Hey!  Umm, can I get a napkin too?
Gunther: Oh, like you don't already have everything.
Phoebe:  Ow! Ow!  
Rachel: Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.

Phoebe: Although, don't feel like you can't visit.
Joey:  Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
Ross:  No, no he's not.
Monica: You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.

Ross: What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Joey: Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
Rachel: Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.

Joey:  Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory. 
Phoebe: Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......  
Ross: Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.

Joey: What did they do?
Ross: Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
Monica: So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?

Monica: Give it. Give it.
Rachel: Okay.
Monica and Rachel: Oh!!

Monica: Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
Phoebe:  No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
Rachel: See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?

Phoebe:  'Hey! You're not dead! Okay, see ya!'
Ben: Monica.
Monica: Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?

Ben: Monica bang!
Rachel: Okay, I heard that.
Monica: Did he just say 'Monica bang'?

Rachel: Uh-huh.
Monica: Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
Ben: Monica bang!

Monica: Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
Rachel: Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?!
Joey: You said number two.

Rachel: I also said number one.
Joey: I know.  
Ross:  Hey! Everyone.

Rachel: He's perfect, he's never been better.
Ross:  What'd you do, take him whaling?
Ben: Monica.

Ross: Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben.
Ben: Monica bang!
Monica: Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
Phoebe: Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
Joey: Uh.

Phoebe: Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
Rachel: Well maybe he's just taking a nap.
Joey: I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
Monica: All right, we should call somebody.
Ross: And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.

Ross: Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...  
Monica: Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!  
Rachel: I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.

Joey: All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
Ross: Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
Phoebe: I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.

Joey: All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke.  Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window  Thread the needle. Thread the needle. 
Phoebe: He's alive! He's a-live!!!
Monica: And yet, we're still poking him.

Joey: Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
Ross: He does not look happy.
Rachel: Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.

Chandler:  I'll hold you close in my arms.  I can't resist your charms. And love....
Phoebe:  Love....
Chandler and Phoebe:I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.

The Guys: We will.  
Monica: Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
Rachel: No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this. 

Phoebe: Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things.  .
Ross: Halftime.
Joey: Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
Rachel: Oh! That would be sooo much fun!

Phoebe: Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever. 
Joey: Great, you can cover Chandler.
Chandler: No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.

Joey: Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
Chandler: Yeah, all right, I'll play.
Phoebe: Yay!!
Rachel: Let's do it! Ross?
Ross: What?

Rachel: Do you wanna play football?
Ross: Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.
Joey: Says who? Your mom?
Monica and Ross: Yeah.
Monica: Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
Chandler: No, no, no, you say that proudly.

Monica:  I won the game.
Ross: Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
Rachel: Um, there was a Geller Cup?

Monica: Okay. Let's bring it in.
Rachel: Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
Ross: Here you go.  

Rachel:  That almost hit me in the face.
Joey: All right, we have to pick captains.
Chandler: And then Tineals.
Phoebe: Okay, so how do we decide that?
Monica: Well, why don't we just bunny up.
Rachel, Chandler, and Joey: What?
Monica and Ross:  Bunny!

Monica: Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
Joey: Thank you.
Rachel: Monica, I'm your best friend.
Ross: Sweetie, don't worry you'll get picked. Chandler.

Rachel: Ross!
Monica: Phoebe.
Ross: Sweetie, now I pick you.

Rachel: You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!
Ross: Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
Monica: All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
Chandler: Wow! Just like in the pros.

Monica: Huddle up.
Joey:  All right, huddle up, right over here.
Phoebe: Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.

Monica: Break.
Chandler: The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.  
Ross: Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!

Chandler: Sorry. I'm sorry. Y'know what, we're just gonna throw it.
Joey: I got it.

Margha: It is okay, if I stay and watch?
Chandler and Joey: Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
Chandler: Well, that went well.
Joey: I think so.

Chandler: Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
Ross: Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
Rachel: Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.

Joey: All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
Chandler: Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!

Joey: After!!
Chandler: Before!!
Rachel: Now, does it really matter?
All: Yes!!
Phoebe: Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?

Ross: Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Monica: Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.

Ross: Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
Phoebe: Woo-yay!!
Monica: No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.

Ross: The Geller Cup.
Chandler: Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
All: Yeah.

Ross: That cup is mine!
Monica: No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
Rachel: All right, so are we not having dinner at all?

Monica: Break!
Joey: Here you go!
Ross: Chandler! Chandler!
Chandler:  Hi.

Monica: What?! I just touched him and he went over.

Sequence 2: Monica runs upfield and stops, waiting for a pass. Ross runs over and pulls her pants down, steps in front of her and intercepts the pass.
Sequence 3: Chandler throws a pass to Ross, who catches it. Phoebe starts screaming and runs up to him and tries to tackle him. But all she ends up doing is running around his waist and screaming.
Sequence 4: Ross hikes the ball to Chandler, and the camera pans down to show Rachel standing deep in the end zone, playing with her gum. Something hits her on the head and she looks up to see where it came from.
Sequence 5: Monica hands the ball off to Phoebe, who runs up field and delivers a fore-arm shiver to Chandler, knocking him over and scores the touchdown, and she yells...
Phoebe: I love this game!!

Ross: Hey, where'd you get that?
Rachel: I went really long.
Monica: Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!

Monica: Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Ross: Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me.
Rachel: I can not believe your trading me!!

Monica: All right then.
Margha:  The game is over, we eat now?
Chandler: No-no-no-no, the game's not over, we're just switching teams.
Joey: Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team.
Ross: Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.

Chandler: And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
Joey: Nice try.  See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
Margha: Oh, my.
Ross: Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys.

Joey: Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I'm not playing with this guy, now.
Chandler: Fine with me.
Ross: Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
Chandler and Joey: What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? 
Margha: Which do I like?

Ross: Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
Margha: Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.
Chandler: Yes!!
Joey: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.

Chandler: Wh-what?
Margha: I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
Joey: Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.

Chandler: We're not gonna lose to girls.
Ross: Hey! It's 42-21!
Joey: This sucks, I was just up by that much!
Monica: Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.

Monica: Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
Rachel: Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!!
Phoebe: All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
Sequence 1: Chandler is running past Phoebe with the ball, Phoebe flashes him, he stops and stares dumbfounded at her. Phoebe then runs up and takes the ball away.
Sequence 2: Phoebe throws the ball, and it's intercepted by Joey, who starts to run up field. Rachel jumps on his back in order to try and tackle him, but she doesn't slow him down. Monica and Phoebe then both grab her legs in order to stop Joey, who still manages to fight through the tackle and score the touchdown.
Sequence 3: Chandler is running with the ball, Phoebe flashes him again, but Chandler covers his eyes, and keeps running. He then runs into a tree at the end of the field.

Monica: Honey, there's a reason.
Rachel: God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
Phoebe: Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.

Monica: Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
The Guys: One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!
Rachel: I'm so sorry! Are you okay?

Monica: No! I'm not okay!
Rachel: I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.
Joey:  Thirty seconds left on the timer!
Chandler: Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!

Monica: Break!
Rachel:  I got a touchdown! We did it!!
Chandler: Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win!
Phoebe: Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going.
Ross: Let go! Let go!

Rachel: We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
Phoebe: Isn't there a national football league.
Chandler: Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.

Chandler: Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
Gunther: Rachel?
Rachel: Yeah.

Sarah: So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.  
Ross: Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
Chandler: Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.

Monica: You broke a little girl's leg?!!
Ross: I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
Chandler:  Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night.  Where exactly were around ten-ish?

Ross: Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
Monica: Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
Rachel: I'm gonna get back to retraining.  

Ross: All right, see you guys.  
Chandler: Look out kids, he's coming!  
Joey: And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
Phoebe: Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.

Joey: Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
Phoebe: Really?
Chandler: Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
Gunther: ...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....
Rachel: Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.  

Ross: Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em!  
Gunther: And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
Rachel:  I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
Joey: Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?

Rachel: I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
Chandler: Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
Gunther: Rachel?

Ross: ....and 12, 22, 18, four...  What?
Chandler: I spelled out boobies.
Monica:  Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?

Ross: Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
Monica:  Oh God!  
Chandler: So, how many have you sold so far?

Ross: Well you sure used a large font.
Chandler: Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
Rachel: Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!

Chandler: Something else I might have said?
Rachel: I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
Ross: Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.

Rachel: You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear.... 
Joey:  Hey! I got great news!
Chandler: Run, Joey! Run for your life!  

Joey: Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
Guy: Looks good. I'll take it.
Phoebe:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one.  

Guy: It's-it's-it's almost dead!
Phoebe: Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
Joey: Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.

Guy: I-I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more.
Joey: Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
Monica:  Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.
Phoebe: Well look no further,  this one's yours! Ahhh.

Chandler:  Hey! How'd the interview go?
Rachel: Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
Ross: Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.  That's not how that was supposed to come out.
Phoebe: This is the worst Christmas ever.

Chandler: Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
Phoebe: Oh! Oh my God!
Joey and Monica:  Merry Christmas!!

Phoebe: You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
Chandler: It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
Rachel:  Hello?  Yeah, this is she.  Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding!  Oh thank you! I love you!

Rachel: Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee.  There you go.  Enjoy.  
Chandler:  Should I tell her I ordered tea?
Ross: No. 

Ross: Oh come on! Here we go!  Stand by for mission countdown!
Joey:  Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight...  Okay, Blast off!
Chandler: I'm an alien. I'm an alien.

Joey: All right, give it back to me.  5 of hearts.
Ross: Real magic does exist.
Rachel: Wow.
Monica: Wow. Joey,  how do you do it?

Joey: I can't tell you that, no.
Ross: Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling.
Rachel: Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
Monica: He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
Phoebe: Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'

Monica: All right, be my guest.
Rachel: Good luck.
Joey: All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye.  I just did it.  I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it.  
All: Oh, I got it.
Phoebe:  Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired...  .
Guy:  Whoa, you are very beautiful.

Chandler: Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Joey: Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Ross: Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.

Gunther:  Hey guys.
Monica: Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
Phoebe: Well, he's very charming.

Joey: Chandler!
Chandler: Hello-dillillio!!
Ross: Oh, somebody's feeling better.
Monica:  Stick out your tongue.

Chandler:  Take off your shirt!
Monica: Oh my!!
Joey: Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.

Chandler: Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
Rachel:  The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Ross: Hi!

Rachel: To be nice.
Ross: Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
Joey: No, only for sex.

Ross: Uh-huh.
Joey's Sisters:  Joey!!! Happy Birthday!!  
Joey: Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
Chandler:  Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
Monica: How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.

Chandler: Hi Joey's sisters!
Phoebe:  Hey!
Cookie: Hey. What are we drinkin' over here.

Phoebe: Wow. Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.
Sister 1:  What 'cha doing?
Chandler: Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
Joey's Sisters: Oh!!

Chandler: No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments?  Those are some huge breasts you have.
Ross: Hi.
Monica: Hi.

Ross:  So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
Rachel: Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
Monica: How ya feelin'?
Chandler: Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.
Phoebe: Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.

Ross: Yeah.
Chandler: Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
All: Woooo hoooo!!!

Monica: Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
Chandler: Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
Phoebe: How can you not know which one?
Rachel: I mean that's unbelievable.

Monica: I mean, was it Gina?
Ross: Which one is Gina?
Rachel: Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.

Monica: No, no, no, that's Dina.
Chandler:  You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!
Phoebe: We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!

Chandler: Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
Monica: That's okay.
Rachel: That's all right.
Ross: That's okay.
Joey:  Can I talk to you for a second?!

Ross: Hey, Joey.
Rachel: Hey.  
Joey: Come on!!  
Chandler: Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.

Rachel:  Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
Ross: No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
Monica: Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark.  I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.

Ross: That is so made up!
Rachel:  Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye!  I got the interview!
Monica: Yay!

Ross: There you go.
Rachel: He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
Monica: Oh, that is amazing!

Chandler:  You're it! Now run and hide!
Mary-Theresa: It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
Joey: What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?

Chandler: I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was.  Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
Joey's Sister: I say, punch him Joey.
All: Yeah! Punch him!!

Chandler: Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
Cookie: So what. I say, punch him.
All: Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!
Joey: No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler.

Cookie: I'll do it.
Joey: No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But,  you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
Chandler: Okay, absolutely!

Monica: Yeah, I do know.
Phoebe: Ick, you were eavesdropping.
Rachel: Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.

Ross: Ah, we'll all go.  Come on.  
Phoebe: Thanks you guys! Thank you.
Chandler: Don't worry.

Rachel:  Tell him. 
Ross:  It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her! 
Chandler: All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday? 

Ross: Hmm? Oh, yeah.  
Phoebe:  Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses! 
Chandler:  It must take you forever to find your keys. 
Rachel:  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs. 

Phoebe: Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles. 
Rachel: No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today. 
Ross: Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch? 

Rachel: Oh. 
Chandler:  Hey, so can you make it on Friday? 
Ross: What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again? 

Ross: She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and,  he's really good looking.  What am I gonna do? 
Chandler: Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings!  Don't cry outloud. 
Joey:  Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical? 

Chandler: I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer. 
Joey: It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco. 
Ross: Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities. 

Mark: Hey, hold on a second. 
Ross: Okay. 
Rachel: Hi honey! 

Jeannine: Night Mon. Night Julio. 
Julio:  Adios. 
Monica: Look Julio, someone left their book here. 

Chandler: ....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?! 
Joey: Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either. 
Phoebe: Well, can you dance at all? 

Joey: Yeah, I can dance, y'know.  
Chandler: Oh no, no, no, no. 
Phoebe:  What, what is that? 

Joey: Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing. 
Chandler: All right, I have to get that, but no-no.  Hello?   Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that.  Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred?  So would I, would I have to provide the grapes? 
Monica:  Hi! 
Phoebe: Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita? 

Monica: It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem. 
Joey: Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me. 
Chandler: Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier. 

Joey:  The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty... 
Chandler: To yourself.  Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good. 
Monica: Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs? 
Phoebe: Oh yeah. 

Monica: All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys. 
Chandler: Bye-bye. 
Phoebe: Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica! 

Mark: Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend. 
Rachel: Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic. 
Man:  Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green? 

Rachel: Yes. 
Man:  One, two, three... 
Quartet:  Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It won't be long before your the boss. 
The Bass Barber: Omm-pah, omm-pah, omm-pah. 

Joey: Mark's a genius! 
Ross: Why?! How?! How is he a genius? 
Chandler: Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you. 

Ross: I don't know you guys. 
Chandler: All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.' 
Joey: And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!' 

Woman: Yeah, but even soo. 
Mark: I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you. 
Rachel: Ohhh! That is soo sweet!  

Mark: What is going on? 
Ross: What's going on?!  That's what's going on!! 
Rachel:  Ross! 

Rachel: Right. 
Chandler: And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and  whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!  
Ross:  Hi. 

Rachel: Hello. 
Chandler: Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen. 
Ross:  I'm sorry, I was an idiot. 

Rachel: Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now? 
Ross: Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away. 
Gunther: Let it be me! Let it be me! 

Rachel: Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.  
Ross: I gotta get going. Bye Chandler. 
Chandler: Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn? 

Rachel: You have a play date with a stripper?! 
Chandler: Man, I gotta get a kid.  
Ross: Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay? 

Man:  Mister Pretensous,  you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner. 
Quartet: Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch. 
Bass Singer: No one likes a buttmunch. 

Chandler: Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
Ross: No thanks. I'm 29.
Rachel:  Oh my God, I gotta go to work!

Ross: Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
Rachel: Right.
Phoebe:  Hi.
All: Hey.
Joey:  Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?

Phoebe: I'm going to let him.
Ross: Okay.
Joey: Cool.
Monica:  Morning.
All: Hey.
Rachel: Somebody got in late last night.

Monica: Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
Phoebe: Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
Ross: So, are you gonna see him again?

Monica: Tomorrow night.
Rachel: Monica, what are you doing?
Chandler: Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.

Phoebe: Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.

Joey:  What are you doing?  Get back over on your side of the...  Hello!!  Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met.

Robert: Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
Phoebe: What?  What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert?  Why are you laughing?!
Ross: Calm down. There's no reason to get testy.

Robert:  Hey!
Joey: Hey!  How's it going?
Ross: Good.

Joey: Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
Rachel: Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
Chandler: I can't believe she cracked your code!

Rachel: Um-hmm.
Joey: Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
Chandler: No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?

Phoebe: Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'
Chandler: We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
Ross: He's right, even if it's to say something complementary.  
Robert:  Hey! 

Phoebe: Okay, listen Robert...
Ross:  Hey, don't we have to...
Chandler: Yeah, we got, um-hmm.

Monica: Ow!
Richard:  Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It's got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
Richard's Date: Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.

Monica: Oh my God! Oh my God!  
Richard: Ah well, this is the living room.
Richard's Date: Impressive.

Singer:  'Cause every time I see your face, I can't help but fall from grace. I know.....
Joey: Wow! This girl is good.
Phoebe: Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
Chandler: I like her.

Phoebe:  Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Chandler: Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
Monica:  Look at you. All jealous.
Ross: Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she's more..  y'know, and you're more  
Singer:  beside meeeee-eeee-ee.  .

Singer: Hey Phoebe.
Phoebe: Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here?
Leslie: I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm....
Chandler:  All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
Joey:  So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.

Phoebe: Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
Joey:  Ah, anything we might of heard of?
Leslie: Ah, yeah, umm.  Home is never far away..
Monica, Ross, and Joey:  Home is Home Star stew.

Phoebe: Where's Chandler?
Joey: Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his...  Whoa-oh!  
Ginger: Joey? Joey Tribbiani? 

Ross: Okay.
Rachel: Well we're gonna miss you around here.
Mark: Yeah, me too.

Phoebe: You never run on a barge!
Joey:  Hey.
Phoebe and Monica: Hey.

Monica: Uh-huh.
Chandler: Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.
Joey:  Morning.

Commercial:  Problem odour in the litter box? Don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
Monica: Sorry, Pheebs.
Joey: Yeah. You okay?
Phoebe: Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?

Chandler: Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
Monica: Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
Rachel: What?!!

Joey: Done.
Phoebe:  Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
Monica: Why?  Do you have a report due?

Phoebe: Oh.
Monica: Hold on.
Joey: So Pheebs what's this guy like?

Phoebe: What is this?
Monica: It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
Chandler:  Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.

Monica: Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
Joey: Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
Chandler: Yeah! You wanna come?

Chandler: Uh-oh.
Joey: Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
Issac: Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you.

Chandler: Well ah, ........y'know.
Chloe: Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Joey: Both of us?  

Sergei:  
Mischa: He's says, 'Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.'
Phoebe: Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up.  Nice,  thank you. This is me. Here.

Phoebe: Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way.
Monica: No.
Ross:  Hey.
Phoebe and Monica: Hey.

Ross: What's that on the bottom?
Monica: Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat.  She's fancy.
Rachel:  Hello.

Ross: What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
Rachel: No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
Phoebe:  Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.
Monica: Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?

Rachel:  Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
Ross: Well you said you couldn't go out so....  
Sophie: You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. That's it, on Monday I start wearing make-up.

Rachel: But I don't, hmm...  Oh, who approved that order?!  Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office.  Get me Mark on the phone!
Sophie: I love Mark.  Do you know Mark?
Ross: Yeah!!

Chloe: I want you to met some friends of mine.  This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!'
Chandler: And that's the only colour that comes in.
Issac: Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?

Mischa: Oh, really.
Phoebe: Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing?
Monica: Well, I was having a conversation.

Joey: So what are you gonna do?
Ross: What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
Chandler: Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.

Rachel: Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
Ross: Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this? 
Mark: Hey, what do you want to drink?

Ross: Who's that?
Rachel: Nobody.
Mark: Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?

Mischa:  And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.
Monica: Oh.  Can I have a tissue?
Phoebe: Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.

Mischa:  Oh, he's unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!!  You silly diplomat, why don't you learn some English, Sergei?
Phoebe: Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?
Monica: Hey, the man's dog just died.

Mischa:  I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
Monica: It will be my pleasure.  My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.  
Sergei: Uh,  plate?
Phoebe: Plate! Yes, plate.

Rachel: Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Ross:  I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this? 
Mark: Hey, what do you want to drink?

Rachel: Bye.
Ross: Chloe, Chloe how's it coming?!!
Chloe:  Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get?

Chandler: Oh my God! Oh my God!
Joey: Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Ross: You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.

Chandler: Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
Ross: What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Joey: Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.

Chandler: He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
Joey: Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
Ross: Yeah, but don't you think....

Chandler: All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.
Ross: Yeah, okay.  
Joey: All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way.  Did you think about the trail?

Monica: Ow!! Ow!!
Phoebe: Ow!!!
Monica and Phoebe: Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!

Phoebe: We're all right.
Monica: We were just waxing our legs.
Chandler: Off?!!

Phoebe: For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
Chandler: Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Joey: Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.

Phoebe: Oh yeah, come here.  
Chandler: Oh, that's mature.
Joey: Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?

Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Monica: That's right.
Ross:  Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
Rachel: I can't talk to you. I can't even look at you right now!

Monica:  Rachel said everything was okay.
Phoebe:  What, what are they talking about?
Ross: Rachel?
Rachel: Just get away from me!

Ross: No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
Rachel: A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
Phoebe: Whe-where did he put it?!

Rachel: Ross, you had sex with another woman!
Monica: Oh my God.
Phoebe: Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
Chandler: Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....

Monica: Oh!!  You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!
Chandler:  He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
Rachel:  Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! 
Ross: No!!

Rachel: Okay! All right! How was she?
Chandler: Uh-oh.
Ross: What?

Rachel: Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
Ross: She was...
Joey: Awful! Horrible!
Chandler: She was not good. Not good.

Joey: Ewwwww!
Chandler: Uh-oh.
Rachel: Good different?
Ross: Nobody likes change.

Ross: What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Phoebe: Should we do something?
Chandler: Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.

Ross: Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
Rachel: Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
Joey: Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore.  
Monica:  What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.

Joey: Why not?!  I'm hungry.
Monica: Because they'll know we've been listening.
Rachel: God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Ross: Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!

Rachel: Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
Chandler: Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
Joey: Yeah, we'll be fine.
Ross: Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.

Chandler:  Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
Phoebe: Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, 'cause it's like 9:15 now, and I'm not there.
Ross: Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
Rachel: All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?

Ross: Order a pizza like, 'I forgive you?'
Joey: Oh man, pizza? I like pizza.  Put olives on the pizza.
Phoebe: We could eat the wax! It's organic.
Chandler: Oh great, food with hair on it.

Phoebe: No, not the used wax.
Chandler: Because that would be crazy?
Ross: Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I'm kinda hungry myself.
Rachel: Fine.  Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.

Ross: You can have the last piece, if you want.
Rachel: Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
Cut to Monica's bedroom, they're all eating the wax, Chandler and Phoebe, don't like it. Joey tries some and makes a face like: 'Hey, that's not so bad.'
Phoebe: They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
Chandler: Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
Monica: What if they don't?
Joey: You think I need a new walk?

Chandler: Are you actually saying these words?
Ross: What, now you're not even taking to me?  Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
Joey: Whoa-ho-ho!  Yeah, okay.
Monica: Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Phoebe: Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.

Phoebe: They've been quiet for a long time.
Joey: Maybe she killed him?
Chandler: Let's go.

Joey: Okay, may I see the comics?
Monica: Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
Chandler: We are. He's meeting us here.

Monica: No! Rachel is meeting us here.
Phoebe: Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
Joey: Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.

Phoebe: Why? What happened now?
Joey: Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
Chandler: Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.

Joey: Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
Phoebe: Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
Chandler: Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.

Phoebe: Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl. 
Joey: Oh, I had the opposite dream.
Chandler: Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.

Monica: Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close.
Rachel: Closer than here?
Phoebe:  Oh, hey, look, I found coffee!  Okay, let's skedaddle.

Rachel: No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair.  
Phoebe: Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.
Joey: Oh yeah.
Monica: Very bad.

Phoebe: Chandler what are you doing?!
Monica: Chandler!!
Chandler:  Oh my God!
Joey: You're smoking again?!

Chandler: Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.  
Rachel: Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I'm asking you first, right?!. I mean I'm playing by the rules.
All: Absolutely, yeah!

Joey:  Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
Phoebe: Wait. Really?! 'Cause mine get me out of tickets.
Ross: Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
Chandler: Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.

Ross: Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
Phoebe: Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. 'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
Joey: Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay.
Monica: Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.

Joey:  Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
Monica: Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
Chandler:  Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.

Joey: What? Mine aren't tinted.
Phoebe: Chandler!!
Chandler: What?

Phoebe: No, the 'No Smoking' sign. There's no smoking in my Grandmother's cab.
Chandler: Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
All: Oh!

Chandler: Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
Monica: What?
Rachel: Okay.

Monica: Ow!
Phoebe:  Aren't you gonna go?
Rachel: No. Thank you.

Monica:  No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
Rachel: Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.'  Well, if everybody's going.  
Phoebe: No, y'know what don't close it  'cause the... keys...are in there.
Chandler: Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
Joey: What's going on?

Chandler: Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
Monica: So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Joey: Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!

Monica: What?!
Rachel: What?!
Joey: Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?

Monica: Please!!
Joey: Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
The Girls: No, not getting my bra!

Joey: If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
Phoebe: Okay, Monica's are the biggest.
Monica: These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
Rachel: What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.

Monica: All right then, your bra would still be big.
Rachel: No, I stuff outside the bra.
Chandler: Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
Phoebe: All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.

Rachel:  Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
Chandler: Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
Phoebe:  Okay, there.
Joey: Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.

Chandler: Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass.
Joey:  And there you go!
All: Oh, yeahhhhh!!!
Monica: Chandler!!

Chandler: At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Phoebe: Okay.  Oh, no!
Rachel: What, what's it, what's going on?

Phoebe: Okay.  Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?  Okay!  Yeah, no they don't do that.
Rachel: Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
Monica: Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.

Rachel: No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.
Phoebe: Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
Monica: So the going for help went well?
Joey: Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
Chandler: I have the lung capacity of a two year old.  

Ross:  717?  Where's 717?  Hey, you've have more of these for Susan right?
Carol: No. But it's okay, I'll just put out pickles or something.
Phoebe:   Ross, thank God.

Ross: Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
Phoebe: I ate a bug.
Monica:  Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.  

Phoebe: Yes, please.
Ross: Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
Carol:   Phoebe, hang on a second.  Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.

Joey: That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
Monica: Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
Rachel:  Op, op, car! Car!!  Ugh!!!
Phoebe: Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
Chandler and Joey: Hey!!

Phoebe: Hi!
Rachel: What is he doing here?!
Ross:He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
All: No! Come on!

Rachel: All right!! Fine! Fine.
Joey: Arrrghh!!
Chandler: Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!
Phoebe:  You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?

Chandler: Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible.
Joey: Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
Monica: I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
Rachel: Ask me what?

Monica: Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
Chandler, Phoebe, and Joey: No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
Rachel: You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
Ross: Excuse me?
Chandler: It's horrible.

Ross: Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
Monica: Here we go again.
Joey: I-I can't handle this, you guys.
Chandler: Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name.

Ross: Hey-hey, it's valid okay? And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
Rachel:  What?!
Monica:  I don't know.

Ross: Okay.
Rachel: Really Joey?
Joey:  What?
Phoebe: Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.

Rachel: No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
Ross: Obviously not to Joey.
Joey:  What?

Ross:  Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
Chandler: Guys, guys, guess who I am?!  
Phoebe: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!!  Look what you're doing to Chandler!!   Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay?  You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay? You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
Joey: Yeah, and not put us in the middle.

Phoebe: Yeah, otherwise, I mean that's, that's, that's just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want?  Can you be civil?
Rachel: Yeah.
Ross: I can.

Phoebe: Okay. Good, all right, let's get back in the car, 'cause it's freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
Joey: Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
Ross: Look, you guys, you guys should go.  No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.

Joey: Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
Ross: No, no, really, I've got to take the car back anyway, I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It's fine, no guilt I promise.
Rachel: Thank you.
Monica: All right, we'll call you when we get back.

Ross: That would be great.
Phoebe: Okay!
Chandler: I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.

Monica: Oh.  
Joey: What-what's so funny?
Gunther:  Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there's none of that in here.
Chandler: Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.

Chandler: Oh.  Nope, that patch is no good.  
Rachel: Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
Ross: Pffhah.

Ross: Sorry.  
Frank:  Hi!
Phoebe: Oh my God!! 

Frank: Oh, yeah!
All: Wow!
Phoebe: My little brother's getting married!!

Frank: Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck.  I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ah, my fiance man!
Chandler: Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
Phoebe: Yeah, isn't it fantastic?
Monica: Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?

Phoebe: What, he's 18.
Ross: Exactly, it'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
Joey: Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
Chandler: Always illegal Joe.
Frank:  Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiance, Mrs. Knight.  
Alice: Y'know it-it's funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all.

Phoebe: Yeah, I'm a big surprise.
Monica: So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
Frank: Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight's ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.
Alice: And he was my best student.

Frank: Yeah, she was my best teacher. 
Alice: Ohhh.  
Chandler: If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
Ross: And so now you guys are gonna be married?

Alice: Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
Rachel: Oh my God!! Great!
Phoebe: Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?
Frank: I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn't want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, 'cause y'know, it'll be me. Right?

Monica: Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Pete: Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward.  Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?
Rachel:  Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know. 

Rachel: All right.
Chandler:  Hi.
Monica: Hey.

Chandler: Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
Monica: Uh, yeah.
Rachel: Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?

Chandler: Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
Rachel: Thank you.
Monica: Here you go.

Chandler: There you go!!
Rachel: Oh my God, Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire. 
Monica: I'm not gonna go out with him.

Ross: All we're saying is don't rush into anything.
Joey: Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
Frank: What, you don't think I know that?

Joey: Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
Ross: Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
Frank: Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.

Joey: Yeah, in a poem maybe.
Ross: No the man's right, that's what I had with Rachel.
Frank: You don't have it anymore?

Ross: It didn't.
Frank: Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice.
Joey: Now, wh-what, what is that like?

Frank: It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
Ross: Yeah, yeah.
Joey:  Why can't I find that?

Ross: Don't ask me, I had it and I blew it!
Joey: Well, I want it!
Frank: You can have it!

Joey: I don't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
Ross: Oh, no! No!
Frank: It's out there man! I've seen it! I got it!!

Pete: Okay, that's great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
All: Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
Secretary: You have a Miss Monica Geller here.

Pete: Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.
Monica: You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
Employee: Umm, I'm still here.

Rachel: Oh my God! The millionaire's here!
Chandler:  Oh my God!  
Monica: Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?

Chandler: Okay, then get the lobster!
Monica:   Hey!
Pete: Hi.
Rachel: Hi!!
Joey: Hey!
Ross: Hi!

Joey: Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
Monica: And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink.  Bye.
All: Oh-no-no-no-no....
Rachel: Just one drink?!

Phoebe: Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't. There's someone here who can explain this better than I can.
Alice: Hi Frank.
Frank: Hi, Mrs. Knight.

Gunther:  Say Rachel, I was wondering if you'd like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, too out there. Maybe you'd just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.
Mark:  Hi!
Rachel: Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!

Monica: I gave you a key for emergencies!
Phoebe: We were out of Doritos.
Ross: Hey, how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
Chandler: Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.

Monica: Two.
Chandler: Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
Joey:  Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!  
Ross: I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
Monica and Phoebe: Oh.

The Director: Joe. How's it going?
Joey: Good.  Hey.
Kate: Hi.

Joey: I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me.
Ross:  Hello.
Chandler and Joey: Hey!

Phoebe: Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
Joey: Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
Chandler: That's not a state Joe.

Joey: Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
Pete: I got to go, so ah, I'll see you guys later.
All: Okay.
Chandler: You're our age!

The Director: Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking.
Joey: Yeah.
Kate: I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.

Spokeswoman: ...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...
Pete:  Hey, can I ask you something?
Monica: Sure.

Kate: Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Joey: Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and it's nothin'. You look at me, and nothin'.  Nothing.
The Director: You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.

Phoebe: Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!
Rachel:  Hey!
Monica: Hey, Rach, how was work?

Chandler: Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
Joey: Yeah! Oh my God!  Is this what it's like to be you?
Monica: Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?

Joey: Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!
Phoebe: Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!
Ross:  Hey!
All: Hey!

Ross: You get the dollhouse.
Monica: I get the dollhouse!
Phoebe: Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
Joey: Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?

Rachel: Hey, Sophie!
Sophie: Hey, Rach!
Chandler: Hey.

Sophie: Hey.
Rachel: Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.
Chandler: Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.  

Rachel: Summer catalogue!  
Chandler: That's the stuff!  
Joanna: Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice.  Hello! You don't work for me.

Rachel:  Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing  Joanna.
Joanna: Bing! That's a great name.
Chandler: Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for 'Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.

Monica: Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
Phoebe:  Hey!
Chandler: Hello.

Phoebe: Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.
Rachel:  Hey!
All: Hello.

Rachel: Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
Ross: I-I know. Well if something comes up...  
Chandler: Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.

Rachel: Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
Phoebe:  Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh!  Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
Monica: Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.

Phoebe: Oh, okay, it's the slide instead of stairs. Watch this.  
Monica: It's very interesting, Phoebe.
Rachel: What's this?

Phoebe: Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?  
Rachel: All right!
Ross: I would!
Monica: Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
Ross and Rachel: Uh-huh.

Phoebe: And, and!  
Ross and Rachel: Ahhhh!!
Chandler:  Hey, my Father's house does that!
Rachel:  O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.

Joey: Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
Kate: I've got no reason to stay. 
The Director: Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I'll see you in the morning.  

Kate: I can't believe we go on in, in a week.
Joey: Hey, it's gonna be all right.
Lauren:  Hey! So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?

Joey: No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
Ross: Ohhhhh!
Monica: You're kidding?! That's great!

Joey: Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.  
Chandler:  I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
Rachel: Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?

Chandler: To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
Monica: Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
Rachel: Well, they always called.

Joey: Nooo.
Lauren:  Hi, Kate!
Kate: Hi, Lauren.

Ross: Yeah.
Phoebe:  Hey!
Monica:  I tried to reach you at work. There's....been a fire.

Chandler: Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.  
Joanna: Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
Rachel: Sophie's desk.

Rachel: Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now.  
Chandler: Ahhhh -- I'm not going to call you.
Joanna: What?

Rachel: So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Monica: Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Phoebe: Oh my God, they took my idea!

Monica: That was you?!
Phoebe: Yeah! Okay, here you go.  
Gunther:  Rachel, I made you a cocoa. 

Chandler: Oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me.  Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
Joey: Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy's theory. Okay?
Ross:  Hey!

Rachel: Ow!!
Monica: Oh God!
Ross:  Hey, you guys! Guess what?

Rachel: Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like.
Ross:  You like it right?
Monica: Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!

Chandler: Okay.  It's a chicken.
Joey: It's cute, huh?
Phoebe: Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?

Chandler: Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
Phoebe: Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love.
Joey: Oh, well no problem there.  

Pete: Yeah, sure. Good luck!
Monica:  I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo!  I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
Phoebe:  Wow! That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.

Chandler: I'll take her back tomorrow.
Joey: Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
Ross:  Hey!

Chandler: Hey!
Ross:  Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think?  This blue suit, or this brown one?
Joey: Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.

Rachel: Okay.
Chandler: Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
Ross:  That's a duck.

Chandler: That's a bad duck!!!  How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
Ross: Oh, it was, nah, well....
Rachel: What thing? What thing?

Ross: Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on.  Easy.
Chandler:  Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!  
Rachel: What thing? What is this thing?

Rachel: Okay. Hang up! That's it! Come on!
Phoebe: No! Rachel, that's what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don't get through, they're not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It's us versus them!
Chandler: Ye-e-es!!
Joey:  Hey.
All: Hey. 

Joey: Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?

Monica: I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!

Joey: Two it is. Ross, how about you?
Ross: Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.
Monica: Really? Who's number two?
Chandler: Who's number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.

Ross: Yeah, kinda. It's this woman from work. I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?
Rachel: No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so...
Joey: But you said one.

Rachel: I meant, me plus one!
Joey: Okay.  Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?
Ross: All right, I'll see you tonight.

Joey: Okay.
Rachel: Okay, bye-bye!
Chandler: Bye!
Monica: Bye-bye!

Rachel: Okay, I need a date!  
Joey: Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
All: Oh!

Joey:  And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.
Monica: Joey, what are you doing?! It's never gonna happen, she's seeing somebody.
Chandler: Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.

Monica: Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late.
Hold Voice: Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
Phoebe: Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.

Rachel: Oh, hi!
Lauren: Hey.

Lauren: Oh, yeah! I-I ran into you in the hallway in your building. It was right after I slept with Joey. He dumped me the next day.
Cailin: So. How'd you guys meet?

Monica: Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
Estelle: Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous! 
Joey: Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.

Estelle: How do you do.  Ooh, you two girls were outstanding!  Did they have representation?
Joey: No, they-they weren't in the play.
Rachel: We're not actors.

Estelle: Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face  and her chest  I could really put something together.
Chandler: Could I borrow it?
Cailin:  Hi! Remember me?
Ross: Hi! Yeah! Tommy's in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he's gonna snap.

Chandler: 7:15.  Watch doesn't work.

Rachel: Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
Ross: No, it's not just 'cause I'm jealous.  I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's... Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Chandler: Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like,  banging his hands together!

Stage Manager: Look, we held the curtain for you buddy. Come on, let's go! Let's go!
Lauren:  Vic! Where have you been, baby?!

Tommy: Hey, mind if I use the phone?
Phoebe: Oh, I...  
Chandler: Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.
Ross:  Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.

Tommy: Yeah, but you didn't.
Ross: No, but it's-it's-it's hot!
Rachel: Ross, would you just stop it! It's getting really old.

Ross: You do Pheebs?

Chandler: Step away from the duck.

Kate: I'm sorry.
Stage Manager: Joey, onstage!
Joey: Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
Lauren:  Where are you Vic?

Kate: Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.
Lauren: Vic! Vic! Vic!!! 
Joey:  In a minute!!

Monica: Phoebe, it's been two days.
Phoebe: Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it's one of those 801 numbers. Right?
Ross: Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.

Phoebe: Sorry, I'm so sorry, I will pay you back.
Chandler: And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone.
All: Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!

Joey: Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.
Chandler: Or... Dick.
Ross:  Hey.
Chandler and Joey: Hey.

Ross: Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.  
Chandler and Joey: Whoa!!!
Chandler: No!!

Ross: Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
Chandler: No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a... 
Rachel:  Hey guys! What's...  

Phoebe: Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.
Rachel: Hi!
Chandler: Hey!
Vince: Hey!

Rachel: Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
Vince: 98 hot saves, highest in the force.
Chandler: Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred. 

Vince:  Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight.  See you Saturday.  
Phoebe: Okay.  
Rachel: Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.

Phoebe: Does a dog's lips move when he reads?  Okay, no they don't.
Ross:  Hey guys!
Joey: Hey.
Rachel: Hi!

Joey:  Well?!
Chandler:  Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Ross: Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.

Joey: Well what is it?!
Ross: He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
Chandler: Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.

Ross:  Yeah, that'd be cool!
Monica: Pete's breaking up with me.
All: What?!

Ross: Well then, what is it?!
Dr. Rhodes: Wait a minute, hold it.  Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
Dr. Johnson: I'm with Hamilton!

Monica:  I gotta go water Pete's plants.  Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
Chandler: Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
Joey: Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
Phoebe:  ...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
Rachel: Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?

Phoebe: Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
Rachel: So Pheebs, pick one of them.
Monica: Yeah. Which one do you like more?

Monica: Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights!  Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away!  Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Ross: Yes, and the dimmer switch.
Joey: Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.

Monica: No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
Chandler:  I-kea! This is comfortable.
Rachel:  This place is amazing.
Phoebe: God, that is the nicest kitchen.

Monica: I know.
Phoebe: No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
Joey: Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.

Monica: Oh it's umm, good! It's umm, it's good, just here watering the plants.

Pete: Okay, I love you.
Monica: I love you.
All: I love you, love you.

Monica: Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
Chandler: So, what do you thing the good news is?
Joey:  Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design.  Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?

Monica: Oh my.
Rachel: Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
Ross: Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!
Pete's Mom: Hello.

Rachel: Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, Look how much money we've got! Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
Monica: Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
Chandler: Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.

Monica: Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
Ross: Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
Rachel: Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
Phoebe: All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
Chandler: Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?

Phoebe: Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
Fireman: Oh sure. Vince?!
Vince: Yo!!  

Phoebe:  I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
Ross: Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.
Monica: Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.

Ross: Gimme this.  
Rachel:  Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Monica: Brides magazines?

Rachel: Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.  
Phoebe:  Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing. 
Monica: It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.  I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.

Rachel: Oh my God.  
Monica: I know.  I need more pie.  
Phoebe: Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?

Rachel: Wow!
Phoebe: Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
Monica: So then, are you going to dump Jason?

Phoebe: Hey!
Jason: I was passin' by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it's kinda cool seeing you up there.  
Vince:  Whoa! Hey-hey! What's going on here? Who is this guy?

Phoebe: I don't know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!
Vince: What?!
Jason: What?!

Phoebe: Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible. 'Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so... I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.
Vince: Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.
Jason: Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break.

Phoebe: Really?!
Jason: Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven't been going out that long. Come on, we haven't even slept together yet. Huh.
Vince: You haven't?

Jason: Y'know Phoebe, I'm gonna make this real easy for you.  
Phoebe:  Well, that could've been really awkward.
Vince: You made him a candle light dinner in the park?

Chandler:  Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
Guru Saj:  Hello, I am Guru Saj-  -Whoa!!  That's supposed to be a duck right? 'Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
Joey: Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?

Chandler: Do you think that there's a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you're driving into town there's-there's like a sign, and it says You're in Sample.  
Monica:  Hey.
All: Hey! 
Rachel: How'd it go with Pete?!
Joey: Tell us!

Monica: You're not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
Billy Crystal: I'm sorry. Ex-excuse us. I'm sorry, it's a little crowded. Do you mind if we...  
Robin Williams: Yeah, could you scooch?
Billy: Yeah, move over just a little bit. 
Robin: Keep on scooching.

Monica: So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
Robin: Why? Why?! What's wrong with me?!
Billy: What's the matter?

Robin: That's the one.
Phoebe: All right, so, so you went to Pete's...
Ross: What happened?
Monica:  I...

Robin: Why is this happening to me?! I don't know, maybe it's my wound.
Monica: Forget it.  
Billy: So it's-it's not heeled yet?

Robin: What is it, Tim?
Billy: It's me, I've been sleeping with your wife.
Joey:  So you're the gynaecologist?

Rachel: So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?
Phoebe: No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name.
Monica: He didn't ask me to marry him.
All: Ohh.

Phoebe: Well then definately don't take his name.
Monica: He wanted to tell me he's gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
The Guys: Pete?!
Rachel: Why?! What is it?

Monica: Yeah, but without the costumes.
Phoebe:  Oh.
Joey: And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.
Chandler: Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are: They're are no rules.

Ross:  That's right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six.  Thank you.   Yeah, we have the reservations.
Rachel: Yes!!
Chandler: All right buddy, way to go!  

Ross:  Dude, what are you doing?
Chandler: Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
Phoebe: Yeesh, what'd you do about it?

Chandler: Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
Monica: I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
Joey: Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.  
Rachel: Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.

Chandler: Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
Monica: Okay, can we please go eat?
Joey: Yeah. What are we getting?

Monica:  Anything but stew.
Ross: All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
Joey: Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell.  Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
Chandler:  What if Joey were president?
Phoebe: Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
Rachel: Yeah.

Hoshi: It's just hard when I know I have e-mail I can't get! 
Monica:  Hi!
Pete: Monica!  Hi honey.

Hoshi: All right, on the table.  
Monica: Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.
Pete: Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin.  A house painter! He used to be a house painter.

Rachel:  Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
Phoebe: Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.  
Bonnie: Hi!

Rachel: Oh, that must be it.
Phoebe:  Well I hope you have fun tonight.
Bonnie: Thanks! You too.

Doug: Bing!  Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun.  Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on.  Wham!  Good one. That was a good one.  Keep at it team.  
Chandler:  What is with him?
Phil: With him? You're is favourite, you're his guy!
Stevens: We never get smacked.

Chandler: Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once.
Phil: Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
Stevens: I'm telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.
Doug:  Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?

Ross: Yeah, it's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
Announcer: From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He's known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!
Monica: I love you, Pete!!!

Announcer: And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He's a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!! 
Monica:  Pete! Pete!! That guy's pretty huge!
Pete: Don't worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent's strength and weight against him.
Ross: Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.

Monica: Four, please.  I'm really nervous.  Thank you.  
Phoebe: So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
Ross: What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.

Phoebe: Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Chandler:  Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
Ross: Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Joey:  Hey, the fight's starting!

Doug: So, in conclusion, the lines all go up  , so I'm happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30.  Phil! Nice job.  Stevens! Way to go!  Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya!   Bing! Good job, couldn't have done it without ya.  
Chandler: Thank you, sir.
Stevens:  Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.

TV Announcer: Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
Chandler: Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Rachel: Oh, I can't watch this.  
Joey: Check it out, he's winning!  Pete's winning!
Monica: Really?!

Joey: No-o-o!!
TV Announcer: Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.
All: Oh! Oh!  
Phoebe: Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
Ross: Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.

Chandler: Tell it again.  Seriously.
Rachel:  I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
Joey: Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
Monica: Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.

Joey: Well, I think we all learned something.
Phoebe:  Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this!  That's my Mom's writing! Look.
Chandler:  Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.

Phoebe: No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F.  Best Friends Forever.
All: Oh!
Rachel: That is so cool.

Phoebe: I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
All: Yeah! Yeah, we can!
Bonnie:  Shoot! I can't go, I have to work!
Ross: That's too bad.
Rachel:  Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.

Monica: Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
Joey: No, it's just my luggage.
Chandler, Monica, and Joey: Hey!!

Joey: Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
Phoebe: Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
Ross: Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?

Phoebe: Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.
Rachel:  Hey! 
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Hey-hey, check out the hat!

Chandler: What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!
Monica: Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Rachel: Ross gave it to me.
Ross: Yeah, I think she looks good.

Ross: Go, go, go!
Rachel: Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
Phoebe: Oy!!
Monica: What's with all this sand?  

Joey: I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
All: No, no!
Monica: What are you crazy?!

Joey: Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it's like a law!
Rachel:  Allll done!
Monica: Aww, thank you.

Rachel: Oh, come on!
Chandler: Big bullies!!
Ross: Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no!
Phoebe:  Oh, hey!

Chandler: Hey!
Ross: Hey!
Phoebe: Oh, so, how are we doing?

Chandler: Bored and bored!
Joey: Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?
All: Noo!!
Monica:  So what's Phoebe like?
Phoebe: I'm kind, caring, and sweet. What's Monica like?

Monica: Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.
Phoebe: Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.
Joey: What?
Rachel: Really?!

Monica:  Totally familiar.  
Rachel: Oh, yeah.
The Guys: Yeah!

Monica: Well, why would she lie to you?
Phoebe: I don't know, but we're having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she's gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don't know! So, you're all bored?
All: Ohh!!
Chandler: Yes!

Phoebe: Okay.  Ooh, y'know we could just do this.  
Chandler: Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
Joey:  OH YES!!!!!
Monica: Strip Happy Days Game?

Joey: Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
Ross: Okay,  Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
Phoebe: Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited.

Ross: Okay, come on!  Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department!   Okay.  Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let's see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
The Girls: Woo-hooooo!!!!
Joey: All right, relax. It's just a shoe.
All: Wooooo!!!!
Rachel:  Okay, your band is playing at Arnold's, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers!

Joey: Actually, y'know it's kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
Rachel:  All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas!  
Ross: Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?

Rachel: I'm just making margaritas.
Ross: Okay.
Monica: I think I'll help her out.   What is going on here?

Rachel:  He is, isn't he? I don't know, I don't know, I mean maybe it's just being here at the beach together or, I don't know. But it's like something...  
Bonnie: Hey!
Ross: Hey!  Hi Bonnie!

Chandler: I don't know.
Rachel:  Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
Phoebe: Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep.

Phoebe: After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
Rachel: Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?
Chandler: Oh, yeah, I don't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
Ross: Good morning.
All: Hey.
Bonnie: Hey! How did everybody sleep?

Rachel: Oh, great.
Monica: Like a log.
Ross and Bonnie: Us too.

Joey: What?!
Phoebe: Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won't tell me.
Rachel: Aww Pheebs, that sucks!

Phoebe: Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays.
Bonnie: Hey, everybody!
All: Wow!!

Joey: But I made cards!!

Joey: I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
Ross: That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
Chandler: Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......

Ross: I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
Bonnie:  Hey!
Chandler: Ahhhh!  

Bonnie:  Don't be too long.
Ross: Okey-dokey!
Chandler: There is not one hair on that head.

Chandler: Hi! I'm Dorf! You're date for the evening.  Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that's good stuff!!

Joey: No?
Chandler: Look, Ross, you have what you want, youre back with Rachel. If you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.

Monica: My God, you cant even look at me! Can you?
Joey: Nope.
Chandler:  Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
Phoebe: No. Im-Im to depressed to talk.

Chandler: Ill give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Ross:  Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
Chandler, Monica, and Joey: NO!!!
Rachel: All right, thats it, you guys! What happened out there?

Monica:  All right!! All right.  I got stung. Stung bad. I couldnt stand. I-I couldnt walk.
Chandler:  We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didnt think we could make it.

Phoebe:  Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.

Ross: So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Phoebe: Well, Im not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that theres y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think shes worried that y'know, shes gonna, shes gonna be replaced.  Well, thats not gonna happen is it? Noo.  Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
Monica: Why cant you use the phone in here?

Phoebe: Well, Im returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. 
Ross: So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebes mom remind anyone of a cat?
Monica: Ross, dont start.

Tony: Wow! Thats ah, thats pretty nice!
Joey: Pretty nice?
Chandler: Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.

Rachel: Do we have to tell her?
Ross: Yes, we have to tell her!
Monica: Oh, but its made her so happy.

Ross: Thank you.
Rachel: I hate when Ross is right!

Chandler: Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!

Rachel: Ohh! Thats so great!
Monica: I know!
Ross:  Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
Chandler: Oh, they said uh, You dont have insurance here, so stop calling us.

Ross: Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
Rachel: Im sorry, sweetie. 
Monica: Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
Phoebe: Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Rachel: Thats a good call. Right.

Ross: I dont know what to say.
Rachel: You could.... say youre sorry to her mom.
Phoebe: I think she would like that.

Ross:  Come here, here, come here, come here,  Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friends mother.
Phoebe: Thank you. We both forgive you.
Rachel: So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?

Rachel:  Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
Joey: Just pickle.
Chandler: Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.

Rachel:  You ah, you didnt say Yes to that did you?
Chandler:  No. No!
Joanna:  Hello, Rachel. 

Mrs. Geller: Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you werent sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something. 
Monica:  Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks Im good.
Phoebe: Okay, I didnt hear that.

The Salesman: Actually, Im not buying. Im selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though youre not really sure what theyre talking about?
Ross: Im telling you its totally unconstituional.
Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, and Rachel: Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Monica: I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. 
All: Nooo!! 
Chandler: it was like the Algonquin kids table. 

Phoebe: Okay, dont panic. Im gonna go to the store, Im gonna get you another set of nails, no ones gonna know, and youre gonna look great.  Oh! Oh, its cause theyre gonna eatthats the problem.
Mrs. Geller:   Honey, dont bite your nails.
Monica: Okay ah, please dont freak out. Umm, but ah, theres a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and theres no way to know which one.

Phoebe: And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
Mrs. Geller:  Im not freaking out.
Monica: Then why are you laughing?

Mrs. Geller: Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, youve never been able to laugh at yourself.
Monica:  Thats right. My Mom doesnt have any faith in me! Oh, thats hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Phoebe: I dont get it.

Chandler: Okay. But if you dont come back soon,  theres pretty much nothing I can do about it!
Joanna:  Oh.
Sophie: Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!

Joanna: Oh great! Ill keep it in my butt with your nose. 
Rachel: Thats weird, she locked the door.
Sophie: Yknow why? Shes got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.

Chandler: What?!
Joanna: Uh-oh, tunnel. 
Rachel:   What?!

Monica: Yes!!
Phoebe: Its hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
Mrs. Geller:  Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.

Monica: Wow!
Phoebe: Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica.   She doesnt know we switched it. 
Mrs. Geller: And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer. 

Chandler:  Hello.
Joey, Rachel, and Ross: Hey!
Monica:  Hello, Chandler. 

Chandler:  I love you. 
Joey: Wh-whats going on?
Phoebe: Oh. 

Joey: No he doesnt!
Chandler:  Two hours, that lasted!
Rachel: So did you break up with Joanna?

Chandler: I think so.
Joey: Well, its good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
Ross: The volcano?

Phoebe: Hey! New wallet, huh?

Chandler: Now, theres two reasons.
Phoebe:  Hey.
All: Hey!

Phoebe: No, I know! I-Im sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Monica: Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.

Rachel: What are you ever gonna use that for?!
Chandler: To pay for the gym.

Chandler: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
Joey: What?!
Rachel: You got fired?! 
Monica: Oh my Gosh!

Phoebe: I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, yknow? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. Its been a really bad day, whore wise.
Mr. Treeger:: Hey Duck, is Chick here?
Chandler: Yeah Bunny-rabbit.
Joey:  So you ah, ready for our last practice?

Gunther: Yeah, whatever. 
Chandler: Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
Monica: Just go up to her and ask her out.  Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?

Chandler: I could die.
Ross: Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
Rachel: Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.

Chandler: Hey! 
Monica: Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
Phoebe:  But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes.  Pretty, huh? 

Chandler: Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
Kathy: I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm waiting for a date.  Oh, and there he is now.
Joey: Hey!

Phoebe:  My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey. 
All: Way to go, Phoebe!
Monica: That cold makes you sound so great.

Phoebe: It's fun, God I love how sexy I am. 
Joey: Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
All: Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
Kathy: No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher.
Rachel: Well, have fun!

Kathy: Okay.
Phoebe: Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
Monica: Y'know what, I like Kathy.
Chandler: Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
Rachel: Yeah, she's...

Chandler: No, I don't.
Phoebe: Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
Ross: Come on, Pheebs lay off him.

Phoebe: Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
Ross:  Hey!
Monica: Hey!

Phoebe: Hey.
Ross:  So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
Monica: Rachel's not here.

Ross: Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
Rachel:  Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.
Monica: Hi, Josh.
Phoebe: Hi.
Josh: Dudes.

Monica: So, did you play in college?  sweatshirt he's wearing.)
Josh: Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
Rachel: Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.

Josh: Dope! 
Phoebe: Wow, cute one!
Monica: Very!
Rachel: I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Ross: Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.

Rachel: What was that?
Ross: Monica knows.
Monica: It's this dumb thing that Ross made up cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.

Ross: Pheebs, what are you doing?
Phoebe: Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
Monica: Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
Chandler:  Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.

Phoebe: Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
Chandler: I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person.  No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
Monica:  Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.

Phoebe: You mean you stole it!  Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
Joey: Hey.
Kathy:  We were just talking about you.
Chandler: Really?!

Monica:  Ross isn't here.
Rachel: Oh.  Stop it!
Josh: So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!

Rachel: Ughh! 
Phoebe:  Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water. 
Monica: Thank you so much Phoebe.

Kathy: Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
Chandler: Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. 
Joey:  I'll be right back.  What was that?

Ross:  Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive.  So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
Monica: No, sorry.
Rachel: Well where's Amanda?

Monica: Ross, cough drops, please?
Ross: At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
Rachel: Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.

Ross: You see Amanda and I have a very special...
Monica:  You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Rachel:  Ohh, that is soo sad.

Monica: That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
Ross: Fine.
Rachel: Sorry.

Phoebe:  And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.
Gunther: Rachel?
Rachel: Yeah.

Cheryl: So, thank you for the delicious dinner. 
Ross: You're welcome for a delicious dinner. 
Phoebe: Hey what are you guys looking at? 
Chandler: Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world. 

Phoebe: Yeah, come to papa. 
Ross: I know! 
Monica: Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her? 
Chandler: Where did you, when did you, how did you...  How did you get a girl like that? 
Rachel: Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what? 

Chandler: Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren. 
Rachel: Oh, honey, that's so sweet. 
Phoebe: Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!" 

Chandler: Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great. 
Phoebe: It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow! 
Monica:  Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye.  I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people. 
Rachel: Oh my God! What happened? 

Monica: Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you! 
Joey: Hey! 
Everyone: Hey. 
Kathy: Can I borrow the keys to your apartment? 

Joey: You can pee here! 
Kathy: Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me. 
Chandler: It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway.  Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday? 

Joey: We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something? 
Everyone: Yeah! 
Rachel: Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice. 

Phoebe: Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language. 
Monica: Hey! 
Rachel: Hey, how'd it go? 

Rachel: What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy. 
Joey:  Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls. 
Chandler: Yes, it is, at Office Max. 

Rachel: What did you get her?  
Chandler: A pen. 
Joey: It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh? 

Chandler: Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah! 
Rachel: Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives? 
Joey: Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!" 

Phoebe: Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill. 
Monica: Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me. 
Mrs. Burkart:  You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave.... 

Chandler: Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic? 
Rachel: Oh! Pathetic!  
Joey:  Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you! 

Mrs. Burkart:  Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes? 
Phoebe: You didn't get the money, did you? 
Monica: Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go! 

Rachel: Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go? 
Monica: Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did. 
Phoebe: Yeah. I'm a hard ass. 

Joey: Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this! 
Chandler: nodding, with mixed feelings Aahhuuhhh.... 
Kathy: Hey. 

Joey: Hey! 
Chandler: Hey! Happy birthday. 
Kathy: Thank you! 

Joey: Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho! 
Chandler: Happy birthday! I'm sorry. 
Kathy: You really didn't have to.  Wow. 

Chandler: Oh, yeah... yeah. 
Joey: Ah. Hm.  Wanna go to bed? 
Kathy: I'll be in in a minute. 

Joey: Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. . 
Chandler: to Kathy Goodnight. 
Kathy: Um, thank you for the gift. 

Casey: Great!  
Chandler:  Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
Joey: That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.

Phoebe: Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
Ross: Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
Monica: Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.

Ross: Yeah.
Monica: He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
Phoebe: I wanna hear "The Sound."

Ross: Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?
Phoebe: Come on, play that funky music white boy.
Monica: Yeah!

Ross: Here we go.  Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions.  Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm...
Chandler:  Oh my God! Play!
Monica:  Boy, that was-that was, umm... terrific.

Chandler: Really, bitchin'!
Phoebe: Wow, it was so -- wow!
Ross: Really?! I mean, really?!!
Rachel: Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!

Ross:  Electrifying.  Emphatic time-time-time...
Monica:  Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
Phoebe:  It's so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!

Ross:  Thank you guys-guys-guys...
Monica:  Hey, aren't you up next?
Phoebe: Oh no, I'm not playing tonight.
Rachel: Why not?

Phoebe: I can't follow Ross! It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
Monica: Phoebe, Ross sucks! 
Rachel: Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.

Phoebe: Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Monica: Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Rachel: Yeah, Phoebe you're... awful!

Ross: Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Monica: Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
Chandler: I kissed Kathy.

Ross: What?
Monica: Are you serious?
Phoebe: Does Joey know?
Chandler: No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?

Monica: You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends.  Which we all appreciate.
Ross: No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.
Chandler: Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
Phoebe: I think maybe, yeah.

Monica: He loves you.
Chandler: Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
Ross: Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
Phoebe: Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
Rachel: I know, I remember that!

Monica: I remember you did.
Chandler: God!!  What am I gonna do?!
Rachel: Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.

Phoebe: Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
Monica:  What?
Rachel: Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
Ross: Thank you, thanks.  Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?

Phoebe: After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
Ross: Yeah, like I could lose it.
Rachel: What?

Chandler:  Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
Phoebe: Look everyone, its the spirit of Thanksgiving!
Rachel: So are things with you and Joey any better?

Chandler: They couldnt be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
Rachel: Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
Ross: Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?

Rachel: You shouldnt.
Phoebe: Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and theres the added mystery of who gets who.
Ross: Who gets whom.  I dont know why I do that.

Rachel: I know, but all that work youre doing to get it ready, I just 
Chandler: Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, cause I wanna trade for her.
Phoebe: I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!

Chandler: Oh thats not true! Thats not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it  Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it  Her initials
Phoebe: Ohh.
Monica: Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.

Chandler: Thanks.
Monica: What is wrong with this freezer?!  Ow! Ow!!
Phoebe: God, what happened?!

Monica: Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
Rachel:  People are trying to sleep in here!
Chandler: Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Phoebe: Open it up, let me see.

Monica: Oh, yknow what, I cant, it really kills.
Chandler: Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
Phoebe: Ooh, God it looks bad.
Rachel: Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.

Monica: No, my eye doctor is Richard! I cant go to him when I dont have a boyfriend!
Chandler: Hes really picky about his patients.
Phoebe: Honey, youve got to go. Whats his office number?

Phoebe: All right I I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
Ross: So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but Im already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Chandler: Oh yknow what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.

KATHY: Oh my God, is it really that bad?
Chandler: I walk into a room and he wont even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
Joey:  Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
GUNTHER: I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.

Doctor: Ill be right with you. Okay?  Thanks, Wendy.
Monica: Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Rachel: Ooh, so cute, that Im thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
Nurse: Dr. Burke will see you know.

Ross: Hes coming here for Thanksgiving!
Rachel: I know, its sick.
Monica: Why is it sick?

Rachel: Because its Richards son! Its like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
Monica: Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand dont you?
Phoebe: Yeah, I can see where Id be your best shot but, no. Im sorry, but I think its twisted.
Ross: Yeah.
Joey:  Whats twisted?

Monica: Me going out with Richards son.
Joey: Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Chandler:  Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
Rachel: Is he okay in there?

Joey: Hes fine!
Ross: Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richards son, youd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
Monica: Fine! Judge all you want to but,  married a lesbian,  left a man at the altar,  fell in love with a gay ice dancer,  threw a girls wooden leg in a fire,  livin in a box!! 
Rachel: So now, what exactly is the point of the box?

Joey: Chandler?
Chandler: The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
Ross:  Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
Rachel:  Why?

Ross:   Now, well see.
Chandler: Air hole! Air hole!! 
Rachel:  Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.

Ross: What did you get?
Rachel: Credit. 
Monica:  Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it!  Hi, Tim.

Joey: Hes doin some thinkin!
Chandler: What happened? What happened?!

Joey: You kissed my girlfriend!
Rachel: Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
Ross: Like em, like em? Or, Id like to get store credit for that amount like em?

Rachel: 
Monica: All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
Tim: Where can I wash up?

Monica: Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
Tim: Thank you.
Rachel: Fancy soap? I thought we were savin that for the Pope!

Monica: See hes nice. Right?
Phoebe: Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "Thats not how your dad used to do it."
Tim: Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?

Monica: I saved you a seat. 
Rachel:  Sick-sick-sick-sick.
Phoebe: Oh, Ill get it. 
Chandler: Gotcha! 
Joey: That doesnt sound like thinking to me!

Chandler: Okay, okay, you got it!
Rachel: Ross, can you pass me the yams?
Ross: Sure! Oh, and Joeys got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.

Rachel: Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
Monica: Oh-ho-ho, weve got company.
Ross: Theres nothing the matter with me. See, Im not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.

Rachel: Okay, fine. 
Chandler: You cant tell, but Im trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
Joey: All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesnt mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise youre just an idiot in a box!

Chandler: Absolutely!
Joey: That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously?  Okay.
Rachel: Dont say that I have no sentiment!  This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed!  This is from the museum from the first time we were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter! 
Ross: I dont know what to say, Im sorry. Though, youre not supposed to take these.  Its like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
Monica:  Ooh, this always happens. 
Tim: Here, let me help. 

Monica: I know!
Joey: Ill get it. 
KATHY:  Oh.

Joey: In the box.
KATHY:  Chandler?
Phoebe: Oh, he-he cant talk right now.

KATHY: By being in a box?
Rachel: Joey, had reasons. 
Phoebe: They were threefold.

KATHY: Oh. Well uh,  you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm  Listen I dont wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I cant stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I dont wanna be the cause of that. So, I dont think we can see each other anymore. Im gonna go to my moms in Chicago, Im gonna stay there for awhile. I think this couldve be something really amazing, but yknow this is probably for the best. Yknow? Im gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler. 
Joey:  Open the box!! 
Rachel: What?!

Rachel: Oh, he sees her!
Monica: Oh, hes catching up to her!
Phoebe: Oh, she sees him! Oh, theyre hugging!
Ross: Hes taking her purse!
Joey: Uhh, thats not them. Im gonna go call the police.

Phoebe: Okay!
Monica: Come on, no peeking! 
Chandler: Our eyes are closed and were about to cross the street. Very good.

Phoebe: Yeah, its for our catering business!
Joey: I think I know that girl.
Monica: All right, umm, were not gonna really keep it this way though.
Rachel: No?

Monica: Oh no-no-no, its only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
All: Yay!!
Phoebe: Oh, in that caseYay!  That was me hopping on board.

Monica: Oh.
Chandler:  Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
Ross: I dont know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but theres this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.

Chandler: Kathys with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
Ross: Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
Phoebe: Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?

Ross: Im gonna call after you!
Chandler: This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
Chandler and Ross: Woooo!!!
Monica: All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Joey: Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?

Chandler: Its not gonna be exactly like last time.
Joey: All right, Ill see you guys.
Chandler and Ross: Whoa-whoa-whoa!

Chandler: Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
Joey: I have an audition, but Ill definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
Ross: Somewhere maybe along the equator?

Joey: Okay. 
Chandler:  Hello.   Its Gandolf!!!  So, are you in town?   Oh, well, well maybe next time then. 
Ross: What happened?

Mr. Posner: You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.

Joey: Ohhh!

Monica: I would love too, but I cant! I mean I just cant, you know that Im not good at confrontation.
Chandler: Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, whos boss.
Joey: Hey, Mon! Im not doing anything, why dont you fire me?

Chandler:  Oh, by the way, that is her full name.

Monica:  All right, Im gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?

Monica: Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Joey: Yeah. Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey. Since I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
A Waiter:  Hey, dragon! Heres your tips from Monday and Tuesday. 

Joey:  Theres like-theres like 300 bucks in this one!
The Waiter: Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.

Chandler: I dont know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
Ross: What?

Chandler: So what job did you get Joe?
Joey: Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
Rachel: Well, how can you be a tour guide, dont you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?

Joey: No, not really. They give you all the information, its uh, its like memorizing a script.  "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.

Joey: Huh.
Monica: What did you tell them?

Phoebe: Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? Im gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
Chandler: Youre gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
Rachel: Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
Monica: Yeah, like youre gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.

Phoebe: Yeah, whats your point?
Ross: Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
Rachel: Wow! I dont know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be akeeper.

Phoebe: Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
Joey: No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, well be supportive like crazy.
All: Yeah.
Monica: We just want you to think it through.
Rachel: Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody whos had a baby. Like your mom?

Kathy: Oh! 
Monica: I am so jealous.
Rachel: You guys are really rightthere arent you?
Chandler: Yes. Right where?

Monica: And the sex?
Chandler: All right, we havent had sex yet. Okay, whats the big deal? Yknow? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
Rachel: Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
Ross: That is really nicelying! No way is that the reason!

Rachel: Why? Just because youre not mature enough to understand something like that?!
Chandler: No, hes right, Im totally lying.
Monica: Then what is it?

Chandler: Yeah?
Rachel: Yeah!
Ross: Just go for it Chandler.
Monica: Yeah, you should.

Chandler: Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Phoebe: Ooh, yknow what, I think its time for puppy to go out again. Come on, lets go to the balcony.
Monica: What?!

Phoebe: Umm, the street. Come on, lets go to the street. Ooh, listen, dont go onto the balcony until after I get back. 
Monica:  So, did you do it?
Chandler: Yes, yes, we had the sex.

Monica: Well, it was the first time. Yknow, theres not always a lot of agreement the first time.
Rachel: Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree  like that.
Chandler: Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, yknow, I know where everything goes, its always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebodys killing her in there!"

Monica: Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.  You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
Chandler:  There are seven?!
Rachel: Let me see that.  Oh, yeah.

Chandler: Oh, yknow-yknow what, I was looking at it upside down.
Rachel: Well, yknow, sometimes that helps. 
Monica:  Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.

Chandler: Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Monica: All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit em all, and you mix em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
Rachel: Oo, toes!! Well, for some people. 

Older Scientist: Dr. Geller, theres a seat over here. 
Ross: Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but Im having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. Im having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if hell sit with me.
Joey:  I will sit with you Dr. Geller. 

Ross: Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yknow what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.  Im Ross! Im divorced, and I have a kid!
Joey:  Im Joey! Im an actor! I dont know squat about dinosaurs!

Phoebe: My moms gonna be here any minute. I cant do this, I cant give him up. Yesno, I can. I dont want to. But I can. No.
Rachel: Oo, I cant watch this, its like Sophies Choice.
Monica: Yknow, I never saw that.

Rachel: Ooh, it was only okay.
Phoebe: Ooh, I cant do this. My mom was right. If I cant-if I cant give him up, then theres no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give ema kidney!
Alice:  Hi!
Frank: Hi!

Alice: None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, were just gonna be right over there  having coffee.
Phoebe: Okay.
Frank:  Oh, whos this little guy?! 

Phoebe: Oh! Ooh! Umm!
Frank: Oh, hes so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour.
Alice: You are so precious, I could just take you home.

Phoebe: Uh-huh, yeah!
Frank: Oh, thanks.
Monica: What are you doing?

Phoebe: No, Im really okay with this. Yknow why? Cause look at them, and I made that, so I know its gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, its gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this.  I wanna carry your baby.
Alice:  Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You dont know what this means to us! Oh!
Frank: Oh my God, I think Im gonna cry!
Monica: Its gonna be so great.
Phoebe Sr:  Hi! Whats going on?

Rachel: What is that noise?
Chandler: You!
Joey: Its the chick! Shesgoing through some changes.
Monica: What kind of changes?

Phoebe: Hey!
Ross: Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?

Phoebe: Hi! Wish me luck!
Monica: Oh, good luck.
Joey: Good luck.  And Im still right!

Monica: That is sooo not true!
Rachel: What?
Joey: Shes mad because I know todays her laundry day and that means shes wearing her old lady underpants.
Chandler: I can check that for ya.

Monica: I justI cant believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
Chandler: Well we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Joey: Yeah, whats that about?

Chandler:  And you Ross, I believe, if you check Rachels bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
Ross:  Youre good.  These are not.
Rachel: Im so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
Monica: Yeah.
Joey: Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?

Ross: Five.
Chandler: Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.

Chandler: I got it! Scotch tape. 
Ross: How did you know she would buy scotch tape?

Chandler: All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
Monica: That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
Rachel: Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.

Monica: Ross will do it.
Ross: Oh sure, "Ross will do it!" Its not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
Rachel: Fine! Well ask Phoebe.

Dr. Zane: It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Phoebe: Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Frank: Well, okay, so whats nowgo get, go get the eggs, put em in there.

Dr. Zane: We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
Phoebe: Thats it! 25 percent? That means thats its like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Frank: Hey, yknow I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
Alice: Sweety, now, shes a woman, not a gumball machine.

Phoebe: Okay, well yknow what, dont worry you guys, cause Im-Im gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Frank: Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
Alice: Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, were kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.

Monica: You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
Joey: Huh.
Rachel: I know! I know, its such a huge, life-altering thing.

Joey: I know.
Ross: The test is ready.
All: Yeah! Yes! 

Ross: Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and Its All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first.  Okay, somebody call it this time.
All: Oh yeah!
Rachel: Tails!

Ross: That is correct.

Chandler: His legs flail about as if independent of his body!

Ross: Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!

Phoebe:  Hey!

Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Heyooh Pheebs, are they in there?
Phoebe: Umm, yeah, uh-huh, theyre implanted.
Monica: How do you feel?

Phoebe: Well, freaked. Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alices like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.
Chandler: Yeah, but I bet it works.
Monica: Really?! How much?!

Phoebe: Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my bodys always been a little faster than Western medicine. 
Rachel:  Oh my God! I cant believe you guys are actually think youre moving in here!
Chandler: Well believe it baby!

Rachel: No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
Joey: You cant just ignore the bet! Its a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!
Monica: Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we wouldve made them get rid of the birds. Right?

Rachel: What?!
Monica: Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
Chandler: I knew it!

Rachel: I dont care, Im not going anywhere.
Chandler: Cool, girl roommate.
Monica: Well?
Phoebe: Nope, not knocked up yet.

Rachel: How did it go?
Monica: I lost our mattresses.
Phoebe:  "Are you in there little fetus? 

Monica: Hey!
Frank and Alice:  Hi!
Alice: Hi, Phoebe! We were just at the drugstore and we got you a little present.
Phoebe: Oh. Oh.
Frank: Umm, its a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test.

Monica: Hey, dont mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
Alice: So umm, you feel like taking a test? Theres only one question.
Phoebe: All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, yknow just remember that its still really early, okay so, if it says that Im not pregnant, that doesnt mean that Im not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I dont go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.

Alice: Okay.
Frank: Okay. 
Phoebe: Great. 
Rachel: Yknow what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
Joey: Hey, dont get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!

Rachel: Well it stupid, unfair question!
Ross: Dont blame the questions!
Chandler: Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!

Rachel: No its not!
Phoebe: You guys! You guys! Youre gonna have a baby! Theyre gonna have a baby!
Frank: MY SISTERS GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!

Chandler: Wow! She looks great. Doesnt she?
Ross: Yeah.
Kathy's Co-Star: Hi!
Kathy: Hi!

Ross: That is one good looking man!
Chandler: Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
Kathy's Co-Star: Sooo, youve been doing this long?
Kathy: No, youre my first. Put the money on the table.

Phoebe: Well, its just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
Monica: Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could justthrow your purses at it.
Rachel: Bloomingdales eliminated my department. 

Monica: Oh my God, are you out of a job?
Rachel: No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
Phoebe: Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?

Rachel: Uh-huh.
Phoebe: That sounds great!
Joey:  Hey! 
Monica: Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You cant eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.

Ross: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Joey: Hey!

Phoebe: Ooh! How was Kathys play?
Ross: Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin guy.
Chandler: Yeah, its like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!

Phoebe: Thats a good idea for a business!
Chandler: Im totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then theyre gonna go to their cast parties and hes gonna try to undermine me. Y'know itll be like, "So wheres your boyfriend, whats-his-name, Chester?" And shell go, "No-no-no, its Chandler." And hell go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
Joey:  That-that is a good trick.

Chandler: All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Joey: Chandler, look theyre actors. Theyre there to do a job, just cause they work together, doesnt mean theyre gonna get together. I mean just cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesnt mean its gonna happen with them.
Ross: Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.

Joey: Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. 
Ross: Yeah.
Phoebe: Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.

Ross: Theyre not a couple!
Phoebe: Oh-okay, I get the game now.
Joey: Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?

Ross: Oh yeah!
Joey: Well okay, so then youre fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.
Chandler: Really?

Chandler: Yeah, I know but
Ross: Oh no-no-no, Im there.
Monica:  Hey!
Joey: Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?

Monica: Okay. 
Joey: No-no, stay right there.  Gettin closer.
Chandler: Okay, okay, but dont worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which Im fairly certain are the same thing.

Joey: Listen also were uh, were watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
Ross: Oh yeah!
Monica: Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.

Joey: Oh yeah, whos playing?
Monica: The players.
Ross: Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.

Chandler: Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
Ross: Here she comes. Dont say a word, okay? Just be cool, dont bey'know you.
Kathy: Hey you guys!

Kathy: Its a good play, isnt it?
Chandler: Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly youre having sex with him.
Ross: Okay, I 

Rachel: Hi-e!!
Phoebe: Ooh, what do I smell?
Joey: I dont know, it smells good.
Monica: Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!

Phoebe: Ooh! 
Monica: Please, have some!
Ross: Oh, yumm!

Monica: Yeah, its just something I picked up.
Ross: Cookies and porn, youre the best mom ever!!
Phoebe: What? What?
Rachel: Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.

Ross: Oh, whatever. 
Monica: Wait! Wait! This isnt take-out!
Phoebe:  Well, I hate to eat and run, but

Monica: Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But Im-Im done now. Theyve suffered enough.
Phoebe: If you wanted to punish them, you shouldve just made them hang out here! 
Rachel: Yeah, thats true.

Monica: All right then, when Im done with this place, its gonna be ten times better than that place!
Phoebe: Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
Chandler: Steps!  Slut!  You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
All: What?!
Ross: So you were right?

Chandler: I confronted her, and she didnt deny it!  I dont live here! 
Ross: Chandler!
Rachel: Chandler, what did she say?
Phoebe: Wait a minute.
Joey: Come here.
Monica: Are you sure?

Rachel: So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. Its just so frustrating!
Phoebe: Why dont you ask him out?
Joey: Oh, yeah, totally! Thats such a turn-on!

Rachel: Really? It doesnt seem desperate?
Joey: Oh-ooh, thats the turn-on.
Phoebe: He just got a divorce right? 

Rachel: I dont even know how I would go about it.
Joey: Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin?"
Phoebe: Oh, please!

Joey:  Hey, how you doin?
Rachel: You know what, Im gonna do that, Im gonna call him up, and Im gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out.  How you doin?  Hi! Joshua? Its Rachel Green from Bloomingdales.  Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, lets see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. Ill see you tomorrow. Bye.   Youve done that a thousand times?
Phoebe: Ive never done that.

Chandler: All right, maybe I should call her.
Joey: No! Forget her, man! You dont need her, you dont need that!
Ross: Hes right, what she did was unforgivable.

Rachel: Really?
Joshua: Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel. 
Mr. Waltham: Good morning.

Joey: Okay, for next time, what do you say?
Rachel: I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
Ross: So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?

Rachel: He didnt turn me down! Hes at the game isnt he? I got the date, Im just not on it!
Monica:  Okay, its ready. Come on.
Joey: Whats ready?

Monica: Just come. 
Ross: Oh my God!
Rachel: Wow! Monica!

Joey:  Thats all right. Hey you guys, you know whats going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, Im doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
All: Great!
Chandler: You dont have to stop having fun just because Im here. Kathy didnt cheat on all of you.  Well, except you. 
Monica: Hey, Joey, I dont think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean its only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?

Monica:  Ohh, shes looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you cant see people through that little hole, can you?  Hello!
Woman: Hello! 

Rachel: Oh well, no I
Emily: Oh, no-no-no, thats not rude! Its perfectly in keeping with a trip that Ive already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone whos got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
Monica: I-I-I think you look great.

Phoebe: Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
Joey:  Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Monica: Oh wait, Joey, you cant go like that! You stink!

Joey: Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I dont have time! Theyre just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
Monica: Yeah. Run ten blocks, thatll help the smell.
Rachel: Heywhoa, slow down.  No, keep moving.  Wow!

Monica: What?
Phoebe: Why?
Rachel: The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.

Phoebe: Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
Rachel: No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "Im Rachel Greep! Im Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in. 
Monica: So you hit her in the face?

Rachel: Honey, thats youre name.
Phoebe: Thats short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
Monica: Hey! Youre wearing pants!
Chandler: Thats right! Where are the guys? Im ready to get drunk and see some strippers.

Monica:  Shh!!  Wait, what?
Chandler: Shes shhing me! Its my phone and shes shhing me!
Phoebe: Shhh!! Please! Whats he saying?

Rachel: Howhow did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! 
Chandler: Maybe, she doesnt hit him all the time. 
Ross: When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldnt be miserable? Im telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
Emily:  Ross! Come quickly! Theres a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!

Ross: Ive gotta go, theres a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard! 
Monica: He had to go, theres a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
Rachel: I dont get this! She was horrible!

The Cigarette Smoking Guy:  Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.

Phoebe: Remember, a virgin for me please.
Monica: Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
Chandler: Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Im just gonna go home and call Kathy.

Monica: So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
Chandler: Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!

Rachel: Yeah, come on! Whats going in on in there? 
Monica: Yeah. And yknow, if you wanna cry, thats okay too.

Chandler: Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldnt picture myself with any of them. 
Monica: They really were pretty, werent they? 
Phoebe: Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.

Chandler:  Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!

Monica: Thats-thats not Phase Three.
Chandler: Well, Im there too!

Joey: Yeah, all right. 
Monica: Hey!
Ross: Hey!
Phoebe: Heyooh so, how was Vermont?

Chandler: Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
The Cigarette Guy: Hi, Im Joshua, Im here to pick up Rachel.
Rachel: No-no-no, that not Joshua.

Monica: They wouldnt have put it there if it didnt do something! How can you not care?
Joey: Like this. 
Rachel: Well, heres another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?

Joey: Sure! It flushes it.
Rachel: Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
Chandler:  Hello!

Joey: Hey!  Ah!! 
Rachel: Guess who we ran into today?!
Monica: Janice?!
Chandler: Isnt this amazing? 

Monica: How have you been?
Janice: Oh well, Im divorced.
Phoebe: Ohhh, wow.

Ross: Oh hey, that was a good one, huh?  Help! Help!
Emily: So how are you? Ive been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, Ive been rather busy.
Devon: Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?

Emily: Oh, Liam. 
Ross: Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or somethingor should I call it  football?
Devon: We were playing rugby.
Liam: In fact were playing a game at the park tomorrow. Youre welcome to play too if you want.

Emily: Well I mean, youre American to start with. You dont even have rugby here.
Ross: Well, we didnt have freedom here until 1776, either so
Devon: So good then! Well see you at Riverside Park at 2:00! Cheers!
Liam: Cheers!

Monica: Done?
Phoebe: Yep!
Rachel:  Hey!
Joey: Hey! Whats up?

Monica: This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them dont work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
Joey:  I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Rachel: Yknow, you-you also couldve used uh, lamps and then followed the light.

Phoebe: Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
Ross: Oh, just hold on a second. Im watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I dont know what the big deal is. Im man enough to play this sport.
Joey: Dude, youre not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
Janice:  Hey there Ross!

Ross:  Hey!
Phoebe:  Janice.
Chandler: Yknow uh, you didnt really have to help me pack.
Janice: Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didnt really leave me much choice. Did you?

Chandler: Im only going to pretend Im moving to Yemen, its the only way I can get rid off her.
Joey: Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
Janice:  Chandler! Come on, Im gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. Its a real space saver.
Phoebe: Yeah, I know, I do that cause it makes me look taller.

Janice: Okay, Chandler, come on!
Chandler:  Okay.  Joey, trade lives with me!
Joey: Nope.  Man look at this! Ross, I cant believe you said youd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
Ross: Hey, I can handle it! All right?
Rachel: Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.

Ross: And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
Joey: Ross!  Theyre gonna kill you!
Phoebe: Well, why are you doing this anyway?

Ross: Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So Im gonna show her how tough I really am!
Rachel:  Im sorry. Im sorry. Youre right, you are a tough guy. Youre the toughest palaeontologist I know.
Joey: All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! Its not like hesChandler!
Chandler:  Thanks!

Joey: Well, maybe thats because youre closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
Emily: Im just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
Ross: All right.

Phoebe: Whoa!  I kinda liked it.
Ross: Okay, I know what I have to do. Ive got to go Red Ross.  Yknow, Red Ross!
Joey: I totally dont know what youre talking about.

Ross: Youll see.
Emily: Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, its his first time.
Liam: You dont say! 

Chandler: No. All right, yknow what, shes  gonna think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand you a library card.
Ticket Counter Attendant: Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we dont take library cards.
Janice: Whats the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?

Emily: Okay.
Ross: Thanks.  I-I think Im dying. I really do. 
Phoebe: Oh, poor baby.

Monica: But it didnt. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Rachel: Oh my God.

Ross: Oh no! That-thatll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Yknow what? Im buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, its in my pocket. 
Joey: Yeah, sure.

Joey: Hey thats what all my relationships are like.
Chandler: Yes, but in Rosss case, they both know in two weeks thats it.

Ross:  Hello! Hello!
Phoebe:  Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, yknow? And I got nauseous.
Chandler: Maybe thats because soy-burgers suck!

Rachel: Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
Chandler: What are you talking about?
Joey: Yeah, what going on?

Rachel: We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But its actually for Joshua.  Look, he said hes not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! 
Ross: Well, as much as Id like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I arent going to be here. All right? I mean, shes going to come by first to say good-bye, and then Ive got a whole special evening planned. So Im sorry, no party.
Joey: Awwww!
Emily:  Hello?

Rachel: Surprise!!!

Emily: No ones ever thrown me a surprise party before!

Rachel: Well, it was all Rosss idea.

Joshua: Hi!

Rachel: No? Yknow, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue. 
Joshua: You okay?  You all right? 
Ross:  So we should probably get going soon.
Emily: Oh, but the partys only just getting started!

Ross: Monica said that did she? 
Phoebe: Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
Joey: A little salami. 

Phoebe: Oooh, yeah. Youre a genius.
Rachel: Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?

Monica: And lucky means, more cleavage? 
Chandler: Does for me.

Rachel: What?
Joey: There was a seen in Footloose...
Chandler: Flashdance.

Joey: What? Were you like in the movie, or Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.

Rachel: Its not Christmas!

Monica: Or Spin the Bottle?
Rachel: Hes not 11!
Emily:  Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.

Rachel: What? Youre leaving?!
Ross: Yes, we have something we have to get to.
Joshua: Uhh, yeah, I think Im going to take-off too.

Chandler: Theres a Phoebe on my sandwich! 
Joey: Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
Phoebe: I cant help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.

Joey: Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. Theres no meat in beer, right?
Ross: Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
Emily: But, we cant go now. It looks like Rachels gonna put on a skit.
Monica: Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Rachel: No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasnt working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.

Rachel: All right, yknow what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat? 
Joey and Chandler:  Oh no-no-no-no!
Chandler: We dont know what could make this go away.
Joey: Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!

Frank:  Oh.
Alice: Right.

Phoebe: No, back to happy. Back to happy!
Alice: No-no-no, no, its going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Yknow itll-itll be like my very own little sweatshop. 
Frank: Yeah, Ive been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.

Mrs. Burgin: Oh, say no more!
Mr. Burgin: Well just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and well be right out of you hair.

Joey: What do you got there?

Chandler: Don't read my condoms!
Monica: Passport, check!  Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check! 
Rachel: Who are you saying "check" too?

Monica: Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check!  My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.
Phoebe: Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.

Monica: Yep! You got the tickets?
Ross: Oh! Got 'em right here,  check!

Ross: Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!
Phoebe: Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don't-can't get up.

Joey: Bye, Pheebs!

Emily: Sorry.
Ross: Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.
Monica: Chicken Kiev?

Ross: Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.
Emily: I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over...  Oh my God!
Monica: It's nice.

Emily: How's it gonna be all right?!
Ross: Uh-huh, I see that.
Monica:  Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened. 

Monica: Oowww!!
Dressmaker: Sorry. Lucky this dress is red!
Emily: We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!

Joey: Oh, I embarrass you? 
Chandler: How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
The Vendor: He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!

Chandler: All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Joey: Oh yeah?  If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
The Vendor: Good choice.

Chandler: Yeah?
Joey: Noo!! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out! Now, I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring.
Monica:  Hey!

Joey:  Oh, Chandler.
Fergie: Hi Chandler!  
Chandler: That's... That's was...
Monica: Oh my God!

Joey:  So, I hear you're single now...
Fergie: Yeah, ummm, I don't like the hat that much. 
Chandler: How did you? How? How?

Joey: Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map and-and... Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Ross: Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.

Monica: Umm...
Chandler: I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Joey: Wait up! 
Ross: Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?

Monica: Okay.
Ross: Come on. 
Chandler: That was pretty intense huh?
Joey: Yeah.  Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!

Emily: Oh God.
Ross: Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles...
Monica: And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and...  You go.

Monica: Hey.
Ross: Hi. Mom. Dad.
Mrs. Geller: Sweetheart. Oh sorry were late, my fault, I insisted on riding the tube.
Mr. Geller:  Judy, the kids..

Mrs. Geller: Jack, that's what they call the subway.
Mr. Geller: Ohh, I thought that you....
Ross and Monica: Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Emily: Ohh, here comes my dad and stepmum. Mister and Misses Geller, this is Steven and Andrea Waltham.
Mr. Waltham:  Hello. Hello. How do you do? How do you do? Very nice to meet you.  Darling it's the Gellers.   Darling, it's the Gellers.  She's very self-absorbed, you know. I should never have married her.
Mrs. Waltham:  Sorry, what?

Waiter: Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta. 
Joey: That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
Chandler: Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.

Joey:  Your different here too. Your mean in England. 
Mr. Geller:  What the hell!!!
Ross: what's up, Dad?

Chandler: I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will.  Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend.  And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her.  Ohh, Dear God.. 
Mrs. Waltham: Hello, Waltham Interiors.
Phoebe: Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.

Mrs. Waltham: No, I'm bored with you now. I'm going to cut you off. 
Phoebe: Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
Chandler:  And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall.  Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily. 
Joey: Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys.  But not as much as I love America.  Could we please..go home now?
Felicity:  Are you going home? I was hoping to get to know you better.

Monica: Well, thanks, we like him.
Drunk Man: My god!! You must have been a teenage when you had him. 
Mr. Geller: There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it.
Ross: Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.

Mr. Geller: All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man. 
Chandler: The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
Monica: Then why would he say it?

Mrs. Geller:  Oh my God! It's like a fairyland.
Mrs. Waltham: I know, it's horrible isn't it?
Monica: Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.

Mrs. Geller: I just hope...
Monica:  You can let some of them go by!
Joey:  Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.

Monica:  Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.
Joey: Okay. 
Ross:  I do. I do. I do.
Chandler: Oh yea, your right. It's the second one.

Felicity: Mmm. 
Joey: Oh, yeah.
Mrs. Geller: There's nothing to discuss. We're not paying for your wine cellar.
Mr. Waltham:  You-you have to meet me in the middle here.
Mr. Geller:  Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass.
Ross: Dad!! 
Emily: What-what's going on?!

Ross: Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN!  That's right!!
Mr. Geller: Okay, okay.
Mr. Waltham: Sorry old boy, sorry. Sorry. Sorry.  I could kill you with my thumb, you know.
Emily: What was all that about?

Mrs. Waltham:  Joey there's a girl on the phone for you.
Joey:  Ohh great!!  Hello. 
Phoebe: Joey, it's Phoebe. Did you stop Rachel?

Joey: Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking.  I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night.  Hey!  I told her "Hey." And now I'm at the front with Ross. It's Phoebe.  He looks pretty mad. Uh...I'd better go.
Phoebe: No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen. 
Chandler: What we did last night was....
Monica: Stupid.

Chandler: I'm coming over tonight though, right?
Monica: Oh yeah. Definitely.
Minister: Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. May the happiness we share with them today be with them always. Now Emily, repeat after me. I, Emily...
Emily: I, Emily...

Minister: Take thee, Emily...
Ross: Take thee, Rachel... Emily.  Emily.
Rachel:  He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?

Minister:  Uhh...Shall I go on?
Transcriber's Note: This is orginally where the season four cliffhanger was.  So you all have to wait four months before reading on.
Emily: Yes, yes, do go on.
Mr. Geller:  He better go on for what I'm paying.
Mr. Waltham: After what he just said, you're paying for the whole bloody lot.

Minister: As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
Mrs. Waltham:  Looks like that might come any minute.
Ross: As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily. 

Minister: You may kiss the bride.
Mrs. Geller:  This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
Emily: Just keep smiling.
Ross: Okay.
Joey: Well, that went well. Yeah.
Chandler: It could've been worse, he could've shot her.

Emily:  You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
Joey:  Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
Ross:  That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here.  She's just fixing her makeup.

Emily: I hate you!!
Ross: And, I love you!! 
Mr. Geller: Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?

Ross: That's true, thanks dad.  People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!! 
Mrs. Waltham: Yes, Waltham interiors.
Phoebe:  Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.

Phoebe: Hello? What kind of bitch hangs up on a doctor!
Chandler: Hey.
Monica: Hey.

Chandler: Okay! 
Rachel: Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
Monica:  Now?

Rachel: Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
Mrs. Geller: Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
Mr. Waltham:  Yes.
Mr. Geller: Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
Joey: Hey, what's up? 

Joey:  You and me, next dance?
Mrs. Waltham: Sweetheart, sweetheart...
Rachel: Yes?

Mrs. Waltham: Red Barbra?
Rachel: Yeah. 
Monica: Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Chandler: Forget it, that's off.

Monica: That's true.
Chandler: The man's got a point.
Rachel: Oh, hi!
Ross: Hi!

Rachel: Right...
Ross: But it absolutely didn't.  It didn't!! It didn't!!
Joey:  Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...

Ross: Look, I'm sorry.
Joey: Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
Rachel:  Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.

Chandler: Oh, hello Rachel.
Rachel: Ross said my name. Okay? My name. 
Monica: How did you get in here?

Rachel: Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Chandler: Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Monica: Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?

Chandler: Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
Monica:  Fifteen minutes.
Rachel: Okay.

Rachel: Hello? Oh, Pheebs!  It's Phoebe!
Chandler: Oh, yay...
Monica: Great...

Rachel: Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...
Chandler:  Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
Monica: But my clothes are-ohh! 

Chandler: Wow, you look...

Joey: Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!

Monica: Okay!
Chandler: Okay!
Ross:  Emily?!

Chandler: Nope, not under here!
Monica: You didn't find her?
Ross: No, I've looked everywhere!

Chandler: Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. 
Ross: No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place.  Right here.
Monica: Well, it's getting late.

Chandler: Yeah, we're gonna go.
Ross: Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Monica: Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.

Chandler: We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
Ross: Em-Emily?  Em-Emily?  Emily! 
Mr. Waltham: No.
Mrs. Waltham: You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.

Mr. Waltham: Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
Mrs. Waltham: Oh yes, there you are.
Rachel:  Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...

Ross:  Hey!

All: Hey!
Joey: Hey, Ross, Bodington's!
Ross: Yeah! 

Joey: Later! 
Ross: Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Monica: Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually,  she should be here by now.

Ross: HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!!  Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
Rachel:  Hi!
All: Hey! 

Ross:  Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store!  Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
Chandler: Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Monica: Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
Rachel: What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.

Chandler: Oh that's not true.
Rachel: Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
Phoebe: London is stupid! Stupid!

Rachel: Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
Phoebe: Oh No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
Monica: I'll do it!

Monica: You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
Rachel: All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
Joey: Say that to him and you're golden. 
Phoebe:  Hey!

Rachel: Hey!
Joey: Hey, Pheebs!
Monica: We got out pictures back from London.  Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
Phoebe:  Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me. 
Chandler: All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?

Phoebe: No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
All: Sorry.
Monica: What happened?
Rachel: Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.

Monica: Oh, good. 
Chandler: So, thanks for having me over! Rach.  Pheebs. 
Joey:  See ya!!  What the hell was that?!

Rachel: Well 
Monica: Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
Joey:  Havin' some trouble?

Monica: Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Rachel: Yes!
Ross: What thing?

Monica: Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might  end up hurting.
Ross: Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.  My God, think of the massacre.
Rachel: I'm gonna do it.

All: Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
Joey: Uh, okay, Pheebs?
Phoebe: Yeah?

Joey: All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
Phoebe: Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
Monica: Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!

Phoebe: That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!" 
Chandler: Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. 
Rachel:  Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I justy'knowstop it!

Ross: Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
Joey: Phoebe!
Chandler: Hey, Pheebs!
Rachel: Phoebe, woo!
Phoebe: Okay, woo! Hi.

Chandler: Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little Y'know, it didn't have any It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
Phoebe: Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
Joey: Mine!
Ross: Wait! It was my plan.

Joey: Which, is the new plan!
Monica: Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
Phoebe: Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!

Monica: Okay. I-I can't watch. 
Rachel: What 'cha readin'?
Ross: The paper.

Ross: Okay, let's go!
Chandler: Atlantic City!
Phoebe: Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones! 
Joey: Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
Monica: Oh my God! You're water broke!
The Guys: Ohh!

Phoebe: All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun! 
All: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
Chandler: Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Ross: Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
Rachel: High-five, the babies are coming! 

Phoebe: Oh my God!
Ross: It's all right.
Nurse: Now, which of you is the father? 

Phoebe: Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.
Nurse:  Okay
Rachel: I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
Joey: Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This  is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?

Phoebe: Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me! 
Ross: Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Monica: Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
Chandler: That's right.
Rachel: You-you're not wearing a jacket.

Rachel: Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
Phoebe: What?!
Ross: Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.

Phoebe: That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
Rachel: Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
Ross: Yeah, he's head of the department.

Phoebe: Ooh, it's not bad.
Chandler: Okay.
Joey: Oh!  And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee! 

Chandler: Hey! You okay?
Joey: Ooh, something hurts!
Phoebe: Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!

Joey: Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
Ross: Hello.
Dr. Harad: Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie. 
Chandler: Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
Monica: That's what it sounded like.

Chandler: All right
Frank:  Hey!
All: Hey!

Joey:  Ross! Get a shot of this.  Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies  Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff. 
Phoebe: Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt eitherOoh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh!  Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
Ross: Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?

Joey: I think Saturday.
Frank:  What's with him?
Phoebe: Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
Dr. Harad:  Okay!

Phoebe: Hey.
Dr. Harad: Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
Chandler: This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?

Dr. Harad: Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
Chandler: All right.
Frank: It's not that weird, is it?
Phoebe: It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
Ross: To be fair, he doesnt seem to be impersonating Fonzie

Ross: Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
Phoebe: Hi! And you're going into what grade?
Dr. Oberman: Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early

Dr. Harad: Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie. 
Rachel: Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
Phoebe: I know, it is.

Phoebe: Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
Dr. Harad:  Oh Fonzie.
Rachel: Y'know who I always liked? Mork.

Phoebe: Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Dr. Harad: Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.
Rachel: Yeah, but umm Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?

Dr. Harad: Yeah, that's right.
Monica:  Hey!
Phoebe: Hi!

Monica:  How are you doing?
Phoebe: Okay, doctor says any minute now.
Frank: Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me a favor and like, like hold them in?

Phoebe: Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
Male Nurse: Hey!
Rachel: Hi!

Male Nurse: Rachel.
Rachel: Monica, this is Dan , one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday.  Uh Dan, Monica.
Dan: Nice to meet you.
Monica: Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
Chandler: So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?

Monica: Chandler!
Dan: Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
Chandler: Oh.

Dan: And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
Chandler: Sure.  And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way. 
Monica: So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?

Dan: Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift.
Monica: Oh, great!
Chandler:  Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
Delivery Room Nurse: No.

Phoebe: Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!
Joey: Ohh, get these things out of me!
Ross: Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.

Dr. Harad: Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please.
Monica: Bye Dan!
Dan: Uh, bye Monica.
Chandler: Bye, momi-moo.

Phoebe: Oh my God!
Dr. Harad: Oh, no-no-no, it's a good one! Fonzie plays the bongos. All right, are you ready? It's time to start pushing.
Joey's Doctor: Are you ready? It's time to try peeing.  Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! It's almost time to try peeing. 

Dr. Harad: Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing! Yeah, here we go!
Dan: I see the head.
Frank: Yes, it has a head! 

Dr. Harad: All right. Here's your first baby.
Frank: YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!! 
Chandler: Yes!

Frank: So gross! 
Dr. Harad: Okay. You ready to push again?
Phoebe: I already had a baby. Leave me alone.

Frank: They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!
Chandler: Okay, keep saying it!
Alice:  Am I too late?!

Joey: Oh my God.
Ross: You did it, man.
Joey's Doctor: Would you like to see them? 

Dan: So, I'll call you tomorrow.
Monica: Great!
Chandler: So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?

Monica: I don't care.
Rachel:  Hi.  Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
Phoebe: But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know

Rachel: Yeah, umm, no honey.
Phoebe: Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
All: Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.

Monica: Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
Phoebe: I know.
Rachel: So does it really hurt as bad as they say?

Monica:  Okay, umm, okay, umm  It's just Joey and Ross.
Rachel: Why aren't you guys at the movie?
Joey: Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
Ross: I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!

Joey: A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
Phoebe: Ugh, PBS!
Monica: What's wrong with PBS?

Phoebe: I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
Ross:  Hello.
Emily:  Hello, Ross?

Ross:  She's talking.
All:  Yay! 
Phoebe: Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
Joey: That he doesn't exist.

Rachel: So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Monica: Ohh, he's really shy. I-I dont think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Chandler: Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.

Rachel: I dont care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
Chandler: Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?
Monica: I might've said that.  Why is that funny?

Chandler: Because I'm very happy for him!  And you, you lucky dog!
Ross:  Hi!
Monica: Hey!

Ross: Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
Chandler: Yes!
Monica: That's great!

Ross: She wants me to move to London.
Monica: But you live here!  You know that.
Rachel: What-what-what are you gonna do?

Phoebe: I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
Chandler:  Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
Monica: Sure!

Chandler: If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Rachel: Chandler!  Is he?
Monica: Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.

Ross: So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.
Chandler: Yes!
Phoebe: Ooh-ohh!
Monica: Great!

Ross: No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
Phoebe: Why?
Monica: What?! You can'twhat did you tell her?

Ross: I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I'm actually asking you!
Chandler: Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
Monica: Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
Phoebe: Yeah.

Chandler: That's true!
Monica: No, you cannot.
Ross: Thanks for the help, problem solved. 

Monica:  You're not on TV.
Joey: Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? 
Chandler: Hey, there he is! There he is!

Emeril:  Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs
Chandler: How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
Monica:  Hi Chandler.

Joey: Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
Phoebe:  Aw, dammit! 
Stage Director: Back on in 30 seconds people!

Ross:  Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. 
Monica: A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
Phoebe: Ooh, it's not a toy.

Joey: A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
Phoebe: Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
Gary Collins:  It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers,  Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!

Monica:  Hi!
Chandler:  Hi! 
Joey: Monica? What time is it?

Chandler: Uhh, 9. 
Joey: But it's dark out.
Monica: Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.

Joey: I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise. 
Monica: I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
Chandler: I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.

Monica: Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
Chandler: I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Ross:  Hey.
Joey: Hey!

Monica: No, she's out shopping.
Ross: Damn!
Chandler: What's going on?

Ross: I have no idea. I mean But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Joey: Doesnt seem like it's going to work, I mean
Rachel:  Hi, guys!

Joey: Hi!
Chandler: Uh, hey!
Rachel: What's going on?

Chandler: We're flipping Monica's mattress.
Joey: So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
Phoebe: Yeah that's better than my way.
Rachel: Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?

Chandler: Aww, man! 
Rachel:  Oh look! A letter from my mom.
Ross: So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?

Rachel: Oh yeah! I know.
Phoebe:  Can you hear anything?
Chandler: Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Monica: Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Joey:  Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.

Monica: Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles
Phoebe: Ooh, Madlibs, mine! 
Chandler: Condoms?
Joey: You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.

Chandler: And condoms are the way to do that?
Ross: Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily
Rachel:  Oh my God! My dog died!

Ross: Le Poo's still alive?!
Rachel: Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh.  Oh my God.
Monica: Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.

Hotel Clerk:  They say he's only got half a tank left.
Chandler: Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
Monica: We're switching rooms again.

Chandler: What? Why?
Monica: This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
Hotel Clerk: Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.

Chandler: Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
Monica:  Hi!
Joey: Hey, you're back too!

Ross: I'm going to the bathroom. 
Joey: Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
Chandler and Phoebe: Yeah, me either.
Monica: Maybe I could do it.
Rachel:  Hi!

Joey: Hi, Rach.
Chandler: Hi!
Phoebe: Hey.
Monica: Hey.
Rachel: Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?

Joey: I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there. 
Rachel: That's not Ross!
Phoebe: Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
Chandler: Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.

Rachel:  Do you even know who Kip is?
Joey: Who cares? You're Rachel!  Who's Kip?
Chandler: Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.

Joey: Oh, that poor bastard.
Rachel: See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
Monica: You're not gonna be phased out!

Rachel: Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.
Phoebe: Okay, but try and get Joey too.
Ross:  Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?

Phoebe: Oh, sure!  Bye Ross!  Forever.
Ross: Hi.
Rachel: Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?

Monica: Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Rachel: Yeah, it's in there. 
Joey:  Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Chandler: Joey, can I talk to you for a second? 

Joey: But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! 
Chandler: No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Monica: Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.

Phoebe: Count for what?
Monica: Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
Joey: I guess I'm done.
Chandler: Fun's over!

Monica: Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
Rachel: Uh-huh!
Joey: I think I'm gonna take-off.

Joey: Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman!  And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
Chandler and Monica: Okay.
Monica: Sorry.
Chandler: Sorry.

Phoebe: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hello!
Monica: Hey, what's that?

Phoebe: Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
Chandler: Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  That didn't happen, I made that up!
Ross:  Hey!
Gunther: Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.

Ross: How come? Everybody else does.
Gunther: You can't.
Monica: What is that?

Ross: Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
Gunther: I'll take it all.
Joey: Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?

Ross: After what I did? Can you blame her?
Phoebe: Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
Joey:  What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
Monica: Now calm down Joey.

Joey: No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
Phoebe: Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Chandler: Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence
Monica: Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?

Phoebe: That might work! 
Joey: Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!  Enh? All right, what do you think?
Chandler: You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli. 
Ross:  No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden.  No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. 

Joey: What's the matter Ross?
Ross: Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
Phoebe: Why?

Ross: Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
Joey: That's way uptown! That's like three trains away!  Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
Chandler: So you're really okay with this?

Ross: Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Chandler: Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
Joey: Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him?  Ow!! He's not even here!!!
Rachel: You guys! You guys!
Monica: We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!

Danny: Yeah?
Rachel: Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
Monica: We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.

Danny: Yesss?
Rachel: Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
Monica: Yeah.

Danny: O-kay!
Monica: Wow! That guy is so rude!
Rachel: Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.

Phoebe: He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
Rachel: Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
Monica: Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.

Ross: What's going on?
Joey: We all hate Emily!
Phoebe: Nooo!!
Monica: No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.

Monica: God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
Phoebe: Oh, I know.
Joey: I kinda feel like it's my fault.
Chandler: Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.

Joey: Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! 
Chandler: Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
Phoebe: All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. 

Chandler: Uh, Ross?
Phoebe: Are you still mad at us?
Ross: Yep.

Phoebe: Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
Ross: Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Joey: Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
Chandler: Yeah, we are so sorry.

Phoebe:  You're kinda stepping on the song. 
Joey: Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
Monica: Whatever you decide, whatever you do.

Phoebe: Yes! Exactly! And that's why
Monica: Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
Ross: Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?

Joey:  I'm not sure.
Rachel:  Hi!
Monica: Hey, look at you! Where have you been?

Rachel: Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
Joey: All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor
Ross: Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!

Rachel: I haven't seen him in so long!
Phoebe: Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
Monica: Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
Joey: It's almost as if he knew.

Monica: I'll get it.  Hello.  Hi Emily!  Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. 
Ross: Hey!  Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner.  Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on.  She wants to say hi.  Hold on.
Phoebe: Hi Emily!
Chandler: Hi!
Emily: Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
Joey: Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!

Emily: She's there?!
Chandler: Oh yeah, there-there she is!
Ross: Yeah, yeah, she's here.

Emily: No.
Joey: I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
Monica: How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!

Joey: You can totally tell! Here look, watch me.  Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown.  Smile! 
Ross: Well, I guess that's it.
All: Why, what happened?

Joey: What happened? What happened?
Ross: My marriage is over.
All: What?!
Monica: Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
Phoebe: Here. 
Rachel: Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?

Chandler: What?! 
Joey: Why?
Ross: Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.

Chandler: How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
Ross: Who needs a lease when it's family!
Joey: Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!

Chandler: Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
Joey: Yeah.
Ross: You got it.

Health Inspector: Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.
Monica: Oh, Larry.
Phoebe: Umm, do health inspectors work on commission? 
Larry: No, bribes.

Phoebe: Okay. 
Larry: I'll check the kitchen floors.
Monica: Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.

Phoebe: Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
Larry:  A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
Monica: Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.

Monica:  Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Rachel: I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
Danny:  Hey!

Rachel: Hi Danny!  Wow! Thirsty huh?
Danny: Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
Monica: Ohh, fun!

Rachel: Yeah.
Danny: Okay, see ya. 
Monica: Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.

Joey: Ross?
Ross:  Hey roomies!
Chandler: Love what you've done with the place.

Ross: Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Joey: Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don'tI was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
Chandler: Oh yeah!

Rachel: Oh, hi Danny.
Danny: Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
Monica: Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.

Rachel: No-no, but I support it.
Danny: Okay,  hope I see you tomorrow night.
Monica: Okay.

Danny: Take care. 
Rachel: Okay.  Walked right into that one didn't he?
Monica: What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!

Chandler: No-no-no-no!
Joey: YES!!
Ross:  Uh fellas, 

Joey: Umm, yum!
Monica:  It's Danny.
Rachel: Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.

Chandler: Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
Ross: I'll take sports.
Joey: Mine! 

Ross: Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
Joey: But it's available now! Isn't it?
Chandler: Yes, it is.

Joey: Okay!
Chandler: There we go!
Ross: Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.

Ross: Oh my God! 
Chandler: Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
Joey: Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.

Ross: I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
Joey: But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Chandler: Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.

Joey: Oh, it's perfect!
Ross:  How about you?
Chandler: It's a kitchen slash bathroom.

Rachel: No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
Monica: Hey, Danny!
Danny: Hey! What's going on?

Monica:  Oh.
Danny: Hey! Rachel!
Rachel: Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.

Danny: Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back. 
Rachel: Yeah, sure.  All right, whose court is the ball in now?
Monica: I thought there wasn't a ball?

Rachel: Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
Danny: You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle. 
Tom: So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.

Chandler: Hey!
Ross: Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
Joey: You're kidding!

Chandler: You're kidding, no!
Ross: Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So
Joey: But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies! 

Ross: Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
Joey: Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there  by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
Chandler: Yeah!

Ross: Are you guys sure about this?
Joey: Definitely!
Chandler: Yes! Ross, you have to stay!

Ross: All right.
Joey: All right!
Chandler: All right, buddy!

Rachel: Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
Ross: I couldn't possibly eat another bite. 
Joey: I need something sweet.
Phoebe: Does anyone wanna watch TV?
All: Yeah, sure.

Phoebe: Oh. Aw, forget it.
Rachel: Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
Joey: Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
Monica: That's very nice.
Chandler: That's sweet, Joey.

Joey: I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Chandler: Are you aware that you're still talking?
Monica: Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Ross: Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
Phoebe: Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.

Ross: I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
Chandler: No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
Rachel: Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?

Ross: You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
Phoebe: I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Chandler: Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"

Ross: In this life, Phoebe.
Phoebe: Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
Joey: Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.

Phoebe: Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
Rachel: I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Monica: Oh, let's not tell this story.
All: Oh, come on!

Joey: Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
Phoebe: Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
Monica:  Hey!

Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: Hey, did you get the turkey bastedOh my God! Oh my God!  Who is that?
Joey: It's Joey.

Monica: Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
Chandler: Arghhhhhh!! 
Joey:  It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!

Chandler:  You did look like an idiot.
Joey: Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
Ross: Yeah that's the same.
Monica: That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Phoebe: Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
All: Which one?

Mrs. Geller: Monica! I think Rachel's here!
Monica: I'll get it!  Happy Thanksgiving!
Big Nosed Rachel: Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
Fat Monica: Oh, why? Why? What happened?

Big Nosed Rachel: Happy Thanksgiving!
Mrs. Geller: You too sweethart!
Ross:  Hey! 
Mr. Geller: Oh my!

Ross: Oh, this is Monica.
Fat Monica: Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Chandler:  Okay.
Mrs. Geller: I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry.

Ross: Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
Mrs. Geller: Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
Fat Monica: Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
Chandler: Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.

Fat Monica: dammit! 
Ross: So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
Big Nosed Rachel: Oh! No, not really.

Ross: Well, that's cool. So did 
Big Nosed Rachel: Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
Fat Monica: I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.

Big Nosed Rachel: Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly.  Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
Ross: Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
Fat Monica: Call them mom and dad you loser!

Ross:  Monica!
Fat Monica: Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
Chandler: Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.

Fat Monica: I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
Big Nosed Rachel: I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
Ross: So Im thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
Chandler: Emotional Knapsack?

Chandler: I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
Phoebe: Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
Ross: I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.

Chandler: I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
Rachel: Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
Monica: Yes, it was!

Rachel: No, it wasn't. It was actually the
Monica:  Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
Phoebe: Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
Chandler: We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!

Mrs. Geller: So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
Rachel: Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
Mr. Geller:  Hi Rachel.

Rachel: Oh hi!
Mr. Geller: Wow, love your new nose!
Mrs. Geller: Jack.

Mr. Geller: What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see? 
Mrs. Geller: I'll get it.
Rachel: No, God! Please, let me! 

Rachel: Hey!
Ross: Hey.  Happy Thanksgiving! 
Mr. Geller:  God, your hair sure is different!
Chandler: Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look. 

Ross: So uh, where's Monica?
Mrs. Geller: She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
Monica: Hi, Chandler.
Chandler: Oh my God!

Monica: What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress? 
Chandler: You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
Ross: Dude!

Chandler: Sorry!
Mrs. Geller: Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
Ross: Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
Monica: So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
Mr. Geller: Dude!

Chandler: Sorry.
Rachel:  Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!
Monica: Well it didn't!

Rachel: Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming.  Hey, what's up? 
Chandler: Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
Monica: Umm, I'd love too!  Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.

The Doctor: What do we got here?
The Paramedic: Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
Ross: Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!

The Doctor: This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
Rachel: You brought a carrot?!
Mrs. Geller: Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
Monica: God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!

Chandler: Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. 
Monica: Chandler! 
Ross:  Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
Joey: You're a dork.

Phoebe:  Ew-eww!! Undies! 
Rachel: All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
Ross: Well, they're not mine!
Chandler: Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
Joey: Yeah, they're mine.

Chandler: See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Ross: Why are they here?
Joey: I don't know uhh  Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
Rachel: Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?

Chandler: Yeah!
Monica: Yeah!
Rachel:  Take 'em!  Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
Joey:  Chandler? A word.

Joey: Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Chandler: Well, yeah actually.
Monica: We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.

Chandler: Help!
Joey: All right! But,  you do it with me once.
Monica: Joey!

Monica: Hey, Phoebe!
Chandler: Hi, Pheebs!
Rachel: Hey, Pheebs!
Joey: Hey, Pheebs!

Rachel: What are you reading?
Phoebe: Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
Chandler: I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.

Phoebe: This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
Ross:  Hi.
Joey: What's wrong buddy?

Ross:  That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything. 
Chandler:  Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
Joey: I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
Phoebe: Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.

Ross: Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
Chandler: Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
Phoebe: Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. 
All: Whoa! Ohh!!
Monica: Phoebe, you are a bad ass!

Rachel: Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anywayumm, what is this book about?
Phoebe: Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
The Teacher: How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?

Rachel: Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
The Teacher: Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here
Phoebe:  You completely stole my answer!

Rachel: Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
Phoebe: Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
The Teacher: What do you think? You in the blue shirt.

Phoebe: Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
Rachel: Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
Ross:  Phoebe! 

Phoebe: Yeah?
Ross: Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
Monica: Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.

Cynthia: I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date! 
Joey: Hiya.
Rachel: Joey, is what she just said ummOh my God.  You were actually gonna  
Chandler: What is going on here?

Joey: You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
Monica: We're so sorry.
Chandler: Yeah.

Rachel: A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
Phoebe: Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
The Teacher:  Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?

Phoebe: Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
The Teacher: Well, go ahead Rachel.
Rachel: Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.

Chandler: Ross?
Ross:  Hey Chandler.  Monica!
Monica: Ross, are you okay?

Ross: Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
Monica: Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
Chandler: And you're okay with that?

Rachel: Look! 
Ross:  Dude! That's my sister! 
Monica:  Give me that!
Phoebe: All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
Joey: No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just I just Kinda
Chandler: All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.

Joey: No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
Rachel: Well, what is the truth?
Ross: Yeah, what's going on?
Phoebe: What's going on?

Joey:  I slept with Monica.
Chandler: Well let's.let's see what everybody thinks of that?
Monica: Oh no!
Ross: You slept with my sister?

Joey: Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
Ross: This is not good for my rage. 
Rachel: Monica, is this true?

Joey: Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
Monica: Yes it's true.
Rachel: Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?

Joey: Ahhoy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
Monica: I guess I wanted to keep it  as a souvenir. 
Ross: My God Monica!!
Chandler: Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?

Joey: But sadly I could not be enticed.
Ross: Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
Monica: I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.

Phoebe: I don't know! I didn't come with her!
Monica:  All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
All: A test?!!

Phoebe: Yeah, yeah, Im going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, Im going to do the whole city.
Monica: You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular. 
Joey: So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?

Phoebe: Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but Im the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages.  I lied.
Rachel: Oh my god. Ok you guys, theres Danny. Watch. Just watch this.  See?! Still pretending hes not interested. Ohh, hes coming over. Just pretend like we dont know him. Weve forgotten who he is.
Danny: Hey guys.
All: Hey Danny.
Monica: Danny? You know Rachel? Shes nice. Shes not bad to look at, right?

Rachel: Thanks, Mon.
Danny: Well, of course.
Monica: Do you want to go out on a date with her?

Rachel: Monica!!!
Danny:  Absolutely! Is Friday okay?
Monica: Fridays perfect...She cant wait.

Ross: All right.  A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious.  That's it?  Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident!  And what is, and what is all this?!  The official rulebook of Fireball.
Joey: Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
Chandler:  Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluidOp! Op! 

Danny: I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
Rachel: You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch?  Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
Danny's Sister:  Oh, I thought I heard you.

Danny: Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
Rachel: Hi!
Krista: Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!

Phoebe: Does it look like a urinal?
Monica: Eww!! 
Ross: So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?

Phoebe: Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry. 
Rachel:  Hey!
Monica: Hey!

Rachel: Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
Ross: Oh-oh, yeah.
Monica: All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.

Ross: Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
Monica: Still, I was quick as a cat.
Rachel: Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.

Chandler:  Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Ross: Joey's not going.
Joey:  I didn't finish my five pages.

Chandler: Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
Ross: Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Joey: Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.

Chandler:  Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
Ross: I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Joey: Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.

Chandler: The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
Ross: I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Joey: Come on look guys, don't fight.

Danny: so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera!
Joey: Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
Chandler: When did that happen to you?!

Joey: Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera!
Chandler: Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Krista: Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it. 
Danny: Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.

Krista: We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
Danny: Yep.  I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
Rachel: Oh, great!
Chandler: Okay, bye!  Oh my God!!
Monica: That was unbelievable! 

Rachel: Okay, see? I told you!
Joey: Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
Chandler: I don't believe they're brother and sister.

Danny: Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
Rachel: Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of
Krista:  Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!

Chandler: Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Ross: Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Joey:  Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!

Ross: Yay!
Chandler: Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game!  Last night!
Joey: No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!

Ross: I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Chandler: Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
Joey: Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?

Chandler: All right. 
Ross: All right. 
Joey: Okay.  "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross 

Ross: I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist.  All right Joey, we get it.  I'm sorry.
Chandler:  I'm sorry too.
Joey: Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.

Ross:  I am sorry, Chandler.
Chandler: I am sorry, Ross.
Joey: A handsome man enters.  Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You,  you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you  well you co-created Fireball. The end.

Jay Leno:  Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?
Joey: All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
Chandler:  We're very happy for you.

Joey: All right, I'll take care of it.
Monica: Oh no, wait! Joey!
Ross:  73! 72! 71!

Joey: Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
Rachel: What?!
Ross: Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.

Rachel: Oh, good point.
Joey: Yeah!
All:  3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
Chandler:  Happy New Year!
Monica: Happy New Year.
Ross:  Happy New Year, Pheebs!
Phoebe: You too!

Ross: Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
Phoebe: Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
Chandler: That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.

Phoebe: Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
Monica: She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
Ross: In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
Chandler: I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!"  And it starts right now!
Joey: All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.

Ross: Ohh.
Phoebe: Really?! How come?
Joey: Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.

Phoebe: Well, I taught me and I love me.
Joey: Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Rachel: Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
Monica: Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.

Woman: I'll see you tomorrow.
Ross: Okay!   Hey!
Chandler and Joey: Hey!

Ross: I just asked that girl out.
Chandler: Nice!
Joey: Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?

Ross: That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Chandler: Horn-swoggle.
Joey: You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?

Chandler: No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. 
Joey: Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! 
Ross: Hi, Pheebs!
Phoebe: Hey! 

Ross: All right, see you later.
Joey: See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson. 
Phoebe: Okay.  Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here,  then you learn here. 

Phoebe: Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
Rachel: I didnt! Even when I found outumm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it. 
Joey: Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out. 

Phoebe: Then don't touch one!!
Ross:  Hi!
Ben: Hi! 
Monica: Hi Ben!

Ben: Auntie Monica!! 
Chandler:  Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants?  Someone comment on the pants!
Rachel: I think they're very nice.
Monica: I like 'em.
Joey: Yeah! 

Monica: I like them a lot.
Chandler: That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight.  Maybe there's something in that area.
Ross: Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow,  I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."

Chandler: Oh come on!! 
Ross:  Okay, seriously, what do you think?
Joey: You look like a freak.
Rachel: Awful, absolutely awful. 

Phoebe: No, but you're questioning my method!
Joey: No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid!  What?! 
Monica: Thank you. 

Phoebe: Oh, fine! Take his side! 
Monica:  I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Chandler:  Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? 

Joey: Well, I'm justif the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
Rachel:  Joey, do you have a minute?
Ross: Dude, what am I gonna

Chandler: Oh my God!
Monica: We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
Ross: This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
All: No. No, you're not a loser.

Ross: Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
Monica: See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
Phoebe: Yeah!
Rachel: That really is something; that's really cool.
Joey: Howdy partner!

Ross: Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides.  I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.  I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.  I would make a good cowboy. 
Monica: Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Chandler: Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep.
Phoebe: Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Rachel: Good luck, honey!

Phoebe: Bye! 
Rachel: Hey, uh, Joey?
Joey: Umm?

Joey: Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen 
Joey and Rachel: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So

Joey: Hey Ross!
Phoebe: Hey!
Ross:  Hey-yeah.  Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please?  Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
All: What? Oh!
Chandler: Sorry man.
Gunther: Here's your scone.

Ross: Oh, thanks Gunther.  STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
Chandler: Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
Phoebe: Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
Rachel: Pheebs, I dont think anyone's mad about that.

Monica: Ooh, and I can do this. 
Both: We can't do that. 
Doug: Hey Bing!   Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?
Chandler: I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh,  this is Monica.  This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.

Monica: Hi, nice to meet you!
Doug: Hi! And this is my wife Kara.
Kara: Nice to meet you Monica. Bing! 

Doug: Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight. 
Monica: What was that?
Chandler: What?

Chandler: Okay, good luck with that. 
Rachel:  Hey!
Monica: Hi!

Phoebe: What?!
Ross: I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in  Actually, thanks!
Joey:  All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?

Doug: Bing! 
Kara: Oww!!
Monica: Game!

Doug: We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.
Monica: Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
Chandler: Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.

Monica: They have racquets don't they?!
Doug: Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
Chandler: Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro?   Please let them win!

Monica: I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Joey: Maybe we should check the trash chute.
Rachel: Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.

Joey: That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: There he is!
Monica: Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!
Ross: Just, y'know out.

Rachel: Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
Phoebe: What were you doing?
Ross: I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.

Rachel: You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
Joey:  He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
Ross: Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!

Janice: Oh! Okay!  You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me! 
Ross: Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say
Phoebe: You two will have very hairy children.

Ross: Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
Rachel: Ross! Janice?!
Joey: All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.

Ross: Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
Phoebe: So are you actually gonna see her again?
Joey: Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!

Joey: Judge rules, no violation.
Phoebe: Ohhh.
Ross:  Hey guys!

Phoebe: Hey!
Joey: Yeah!
Ross: Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice! 

Joey: What?!
Phoebe: Are you serious?!
Ross: Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours.  It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.

Doug: But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill. 
Kara: So how do you kids like your coffee?
Monica: Oh, none for me. Thanks.
Chandler: Just a little bit of sugar.

Doug: Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh? 
Monica:  How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Chandler: Oh, you get used to it.

Monica: I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Chandler: Oh. 
Doug:  Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself.  Did you hear what I said Bing?

Joey: Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
Rachel: What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
Chandler:  All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Monica: Sorry! I'm justI'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!

Gunther: Here you go. 
Ross: Thanks!
Janice: Actually, I should get going.

Ross: I am now.
Janice: Okay.
Joey: Umm, hi.

Chandler: Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
Ross:  Hey.
Joey: Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! 

Ross:  This would be the place where you explain the hat.
Joey: Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff. 
Chandler: And you're gonna make them all disappear.

Joey: Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
Chandler: Done.
Rachel: Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.

Joey: All right. 
Ross: Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Chandler: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.
Rachel: What?

Ross: Is everything okay?
Joey: Are you all right?
Phoebe: Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.

Joey: Pheebs! Sorry!
Phoebe: It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
Rachel: Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?

Phoebe: Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
Monica:  Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
Ross: Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.

Monica:  Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
Phoebe: Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
Joey: Pheebs, I'm so sorry.

Chandler: Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
Joey: What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Ross: Your make-up!
Rachel:  Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.

Joey: All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
Ross: What's the part, Anti-man?
Rachel: Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.

Phoebe: Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.
Rachel: Hi sweetie!
Ross: Hey, how are you holding up?
Joey: Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.

Phoebe: Thanks!
Chandler: Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
Man: Oops, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Is this the umm, the memorial?

Phoebe: Really?! What's your name?
Man: Umm, Frank Buffay. 
Frank Sr.:  Y'know what? Strike that. My name uh, actually is-is Joe. Uh, Joe umm, Hill.

Phoebe: Oh my God!
Monica: What?! What honey?
Ross: What happened?

Monica: Oh, did you catch him?!
Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Ross: Wh-what did he say?!

Joey:  Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
Rachel: Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
Chandler: And a date with a man!

Joey: Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey,  comes with a bag! 
Phoebe: All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Rachel: Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?

Phoebe: Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
Ross: Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger!  I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!"  I kinda scared myself.
Monica: Well, at least you scared someone.

Phoebe:  He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
Monica: No he's not!
Chandler:  Yes, he is!

Joey:  Hi.
All: Hey!
Chandler: Hey man, how did the audition go?

Joey: Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!
Chandler: Oh my God!
Ross: Nooooo!

Joey: I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach?  Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Rachel: Honey wait, Joey, Im sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it 
Chandler: Oh, hey! 

Phoebe:  Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
Rachel: I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
Ross: Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.

Rachel: Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
Chandler: And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Ross: Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
All: Good idea! Yes!

Ross: Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
Rachel: Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
Phoebe: It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.

Ross:  Ohh. 
Rachel: Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom. 
Phoebe:  Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler!  Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!  Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!

Rachel: Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
Ross:  What's going on?
Phoebe and Rachel: Ohhh!!!

Phoebe: Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
Joey:  Hey guys!
Rachel: Joey! Come here! Come here!

Joey: You mean how they're friends and nothing more? 
Rachel: No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window.  Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
Phoebe: Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?

Joey: Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Phoebe: Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
Rachel: Wh-what do you mean?

Phoebe: Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
Rachel: Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
Joey: No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.

Rachel: Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
Joey: I can't take any
Phoebe: No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!

Joey: Ugh.
Phoebe: Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
Rachel: Okay.

Phoebe: And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
Chandler:  Hello children!
All: Hey!

Rachel: Oh.
Monica: Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
Chandler: Sure, I'll do it with ya.

Monica: I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
Phoebe: I have quarters! 
Ross:  Hey!
Rachel: Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?

Ross: Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again! 
Rachel: All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Monica: Bye!
All: Bye!
Phoebe: Bye Chandler!   I miss you already. 
Chandler:  Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!

Chandler: Phoebe knows about us!
Joey: Well I didn't tell them!
Monica: Them?! Who's them?

Ross: Noooo.
Rachel: Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
Phoebe: Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?

Ross: Huh?
Rachel: You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
Joey: I'm listening.

Rachel:  See?
Ross: That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
Phoebe: He broke that.

Ross: Well, he had gravity boots.
Rachel: Yeah, he broke those too.
Joey: So he likes to break stuff.

Ross: Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out.  Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
Phoebe: I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
Joey: Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.

Ross: Right. 
Rachel: Hello!  Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here!  It's Chandler.
Phoebe:  Oh?  Hello you.
Chandler: Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day. 

Phoebe: No!
Rachel: I can not believe he would do that to MonWhoa!  Joey, do they know that we know?
Joey: No.

Monica: Oh yeah!
Phoebe: All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
Rachel: All right. Be sexy.

Rachel: Okay! 
Phoebe: And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses? 
Monica: All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
Chandler: Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?

Monica: Just go get some!  Go! 
Rachel:  Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
Phoebe: Okay.

Rachel: Yeah, oh wait!  
Phoebe: Oh now, don't give away the farm!
Chandler: Phoebe.

Chandler: Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! 
Phoebe: He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Joey:  Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
Rachel: Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.

Joey: It's not my first time.
Monica: You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Chandler: Okay, give me a second!  Did you clean up in here?

Monica: Of course.
Chandler: Oh, you're-you're going?
Phoebe: Umm, not without you, lover.  So, this is my bra.

Chandler: Love her! That's right, ILOVEHER!!! I love her!!  I love you, Monica.
Monica: I love you too Chandler. 
Phoebe: I justI thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Joey: Dude!

Chandler: And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.
Phoebe: God! 
Joey: All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Monica: Well actually, Ross doesn't.

Ross: Chandler!!! Chandler!!!  Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Chandler:  Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! 
Monica: What are you doing?!

Chandler: Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
Monica: Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross.   Hold on!  Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Ross: What the hell are doing?!!
Rachel:  Hey, what's-what's going on?!

Chandler: Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Joey:  Dude! He's right there!
Ross:  I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!

Chandler: Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Monica: I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
Ross:  My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.   You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
Rachel: Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.

Ross: Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids
Chandler:  Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
Joey:  I call Godfather!

Ross: You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
Joey: Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
Monica: Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
Chandler: Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
Rachel: Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
Phoebe: Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.

Rachel: Okay.
Joey:  Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
Katie: Hi!
All: Hi!

Joey: I was thinking Chinese food.
Katie: Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?! 
Rachel: She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!

Ross: Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
Phoebe: Yeah!
Guy: Hi!

Ross: Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
Steve: Oh hi Phoebe.
Phoebe: Mr. President.

Ross: so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
Chandler:  Sounds like a fun party.
Rachel: Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.

Ross: Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags. 
Rachel: And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Chandler: Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.

Chandler: By me?
Ross: Oh, no!
Joey: No-no.

Joey: Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
Monica: Gunther, can I get a coffee  to go?
Chandler: Monica. 

Party Guests:  Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard!  Howard! Howard! Howard!  Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard!  Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!
Ross: Phoebe! 
Phoebe: Oh, hi Ross!

Ross: What are you doing?
Phoebe: Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out its a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man! 
Guest 1: See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!

Ross: Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
Phoebe: No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
Steve:  Oh hey, Pheebs!

Joey: Hey! Hiya!
Rachel: Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
Katie: Oh, thanks! That's so sweet! 

Rachel: Ohh, you're so sweet! 
Katie: Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
Joey: Huh.

Ross:  Ohh, this cake is really good!
Phoebe: Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
Guest 2:  Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake!  Who would do a think like that?
Steve: 3-B!
All: Oh yeah, aww!

Steve: Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think it's time you went home?!
Guest 3: Yeah, leave!
All: Yeah, get out! Now!

Chandler: Will you marry me?
Ross: Oh-no. No. No.
Joey: What a bad idea!
Rachel: Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! 
Monica: Chandler, why are you doing this?

Chandler: Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys. 
Monica: Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
Ross: Hey!
Joey: She's right y'know.

Ross: Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
Monica: Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
Chandler: I didn't think I was!

Joey: Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
Ross: You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
Phoebe: Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Rachel: Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
Chandler: Okay, how long is this going to go on.
Monica: Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.

Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Monica: Hey!

Joey:  Dark red.
Chandler: Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later.  Hey, how about maroon?
Monica:  Yes, you are so smart! 

Rachel: A couple of bucks.
Phoebe: Okay, dime!  You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while.  Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa!  Oh my God, this is a police badge!
Monica: Wow!
Chandler: Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts.  Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.

Rachel: Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
Phoebe: Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! 
Joey:  Hey, you guys!
Chandler: Hey!

Rachel: Hey Joey!
Monica: Hey.
Joey:  Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?

Rachel: Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
The Salesman: You picked a great couch.
Ross: Yeah?

The Salesman: Yeah. Could you just sign right here please? 
Ross: Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Rachel: Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!

Ross: Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together. 
The Salesman: Ohh, okay.  Something didn't quite add up there. 
Rachel: Ross!

Ross: What's that supposed to mean?
Rachel: Ross!
The Salesman: Well you, her, I mean, she's veryy'know. And you're likey'know.

Phoebe:  Hey.
Joey:  Hey!  Oh.
Chandler: Hi, Joe.

Joey: It-it doesnt?
Monica: No!
Chandler: No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.

Joey: In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
Monica: Um-hmm.
Chandler: Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?

Joey:  Not really.
Chandler: Well there you have it!
Monica: Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats!  But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!

Joey: No, never done that either.
Rachel:  Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
Chandler: Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
Monica:  That's right.

Ross: Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
Rachel: Well, I brought the next best thing.
Chandler:  Hey!

Ross: Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead. 
Rachel: Okay!
Chandler: Okay.

Ross: Turn! Turn!
Chandler: Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
Rachel: Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.

Joey:  Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor? 
Monica: Who is it?
Voice: N.Y.P.D!!
Phoebe and Joey: Oh my God!

Joey: Uhh, just a minute officer!! 
Cop: I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!
Phoebe: Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
Rachel: Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!

Phoebe: Me?!
Cop: Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.
Chandler and Joey: Nice!

Rachel: Hi. 
Phoebe: Very good handshake, good wrist action.
Monica: Let me try. 

Gary's Radio: We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
Gary: Okay, now I've really have to go!
Phoebe: But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.

Gary: I know, but it's my job, sweethart!
Phoebe: Okay, then maybe I can come too!
Gary's Radio: Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.

Phoebe:  God, I woke the beast. Sorry.  I was wrong obviously, I justI misspoke. It's okay.
Monica: Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Chandler:  Hey Monica, here's your broom back.

Chandler: Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
Rachel: Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
Joey: Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?

Rachel: I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
Monica: Yes!
Joey: I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?

Rachel: What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Joey: Yeah!  No?
Monica: A kiss? What are you talking about?

Joey: Damnit!! Did you move?!
Ross: Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place.  I'm Ross.
The Old Man: Yes?

Chandler: Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you 
Gary: Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
Monica: Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
Phoebe: Oh we can't, we already have plans.

Chandler: No, you're the best.
Monica: I am the best.
Joey:  Hey guys!  What 'cha been doin'? 

Phoebe: You tired Chandler?
Monica: You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
Chandler: Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
Gary: So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?

Chandler: Oh yeah, it's so cool.  Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100.  That's pee-pee. 
Monica: Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Phoebe: Ohh,  umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
Gary: Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so

Rachel:  I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
Monica: Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
Chandler:  You guys ready fore the movies?

Joey:  Is that your card? 
Chandler:  Yes. 
Carol:  Hey guys!
Ross: Hi!

Chandler: Hi there!
Ben: Hi!!
Carol: Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
Phoebe: What are you talking about?!
Ross:  Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
Joey:  Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town!  Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!  I mean, way to go Ben!  Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.

Rachel:  Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
Joey: Luck!
Chandler: Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?

Rachel: Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day
Chandler: Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Monica: Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.

Rachel: Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
All: Good luck! Go get 'em! 
Phoebe: Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
Joey: Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.

Phoebe: Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
Monica: I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Joey: Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
Ross:  Okay!!

Joey: Done.
Phoebe: Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
Monica: I would love to do it together!

Joey: What, so I gotta shut it down now?
Ross: All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
Monica: It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.

Ross: Yeah.
Chandler: Weirder than watching his two moms make out? 
Joey: Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?

Kim: Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
Nancy: She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
Rachel:  Oh, what a fun office.

Rachel: Yeah, I can do that.
Chandler: Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
Phoebe:  Hey!
Monica: Hey!

Phoebe: I got it! Mine!
Ross:  Hi.
Monica: Hey! How'd the audition go?!

Ross:  Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
Joey:  Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
Monica: You got a callback too didn't you?

Kim: So anyway we really  Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
Nancy: Oh, sorry!
Rachel: Oh that's okay.

Kim: Oh that's great! You are the best!
Rachel: Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?  Y'know what, actually  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
Nancy: I thought you didn't smoke.

Ross: Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
Joey: Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so
Carol: Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?

Joey: Who knows?
The Casting Director:  Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
Ross: Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!

Joey: Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Ross: Yeah!
The Casting Director: Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two  or you two.  

Joey: Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
Ross: Yeah, it is.
Kyle: Yeah. It's gonna be weird.

Phoebe: Umm, cups.
Chandler: Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Ross: Seriously that's a lot of cups.

Phoebe: Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!
Joey: Hey Pheebs!  Hey!
Ross: Hey!

Joey: What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
Chandler:  Well I mean, let me get the door first.  Oh, hi! No one. 
Ross: Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.

Monica: No, I'm-I'm serious!
Rachel: Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
Chandler: Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!

Rachel: All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
Chandler: I wish I had smoked for my career
Monica: That's so gross!

Rachel: No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
Chandler: Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
Monica: Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding. 

Kim: So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
Nancy: Absolutely!
Rachel: I am so on board! 

Kim: Rachel didn't you just light that?
Rachel: Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.
Nancy: I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.

Kim: Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like 
Nancy: Tell me about it!
Rachel: Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!

Kim: It does sound appealing.
Nancy: Oh, I never could do it.
Rachel: Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!

Joey:  Ross!
Ross:  Ben!   I mean, Ben! Ben!
The Casting Director:  Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.

Joey: Hmm, soup.  I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
Raymond: COME ON!!!!
The Casting Director: Y'know what? We need to move on.

Rachel: Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Kim: Yeah. That didn't work out.
Nancy: Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!

Phoebe:  Check it out! Cup hat!  Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup! 
Chandler: Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
Monica:  Why don't you just go out with her!

Phoebe:  And did you notice the ice?  Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch!  Ahhh! Mystical!
Chandler: Awesome!
Monica: Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!

Chandler: Thank you! Thank you! 
Phoebe:  Oh, look! Look! Look!
All: Surprise!!
Rachel: What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
Monica: That's the surprise!

Rachel: Oh, okay, not so weird.
Ross: Hey!
Joey: Hey.

Ross: Wow! How'd you get in there?
Chandler: Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert. 
Delivery Girl: Hi Chandler!

Rachel: No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
Phoebe: Don't get me started on that.
Chandler: I was not flirting.
Ross: And on your anniversary, for shame!

Rachel: What's going on?
Ross: Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
Chandler: I was not and oh God, shh!

Ross: Well
Chandler: Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Rachel: Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.

Ross: And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little
Rachel: Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements. 
Phoebe:  Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!

Ross: This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
Phoebe: See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Joey:  Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
Rachel: Big night!

Phoebe: This is so cool!
Chandler: So, Joey on Law  Order, you must be very proud!
Joey: Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.

Joey: Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so
Monica:  Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Chandler: Happy Anniversary, 10 months! 

Monica: Great!
Phoebe: Okay!  Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.
Rachel: Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back. 
Joey: Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?

Chandler: If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
Monica:  Rach? What are you doing?
Rachel: Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!

Monica: It's a diaper commercial.
Rachel: Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
Caitlin: Pizza delivery!
Ross: I'll get it! I will get that! 

Caitlin: I'm gonna try. 
Chandler: You're welcome.
Ross: You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!

Chandler: What?
Ross: This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
Monica: What's goin' on?

Ross: Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
Chandler: Thank you for that!  I was not flirting.
Monica: It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.

Ross: Really?!
Chandler: Really?!
Monica: It's no big deal, I do it all the time.

Chandler: Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
Joey:  True story! 
Monica: Chandler, this actually bothers you?

Chandler: Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
Rachel: Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
Ross: And thank you, for that.

Rachel: Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
Ross: All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number!  And not the one on the menu!
Phoebe:  I found it!

Monica: What?
Joey:  Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
Chandler:  Well, what is it?

Phoebe:  That's not good.
Joey:  No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! 
Rachel:  Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
Chandler:  If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
Grandma Tribbiani: 

Joey: No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
Grandma Tribbiani: No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
Chandler: Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
Monica:  Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
Phoebe: But I already gave them back to you!

Monica: No you didn't.
Phoebe: All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said.  Where is that other earring?
Rachel: It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay! 

Phoebe: Ohh! I did not get that.
Chandler: So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law  Order?
Monica: Yeah, it's good.

Chandler: All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
Joey:  All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
Ross: Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like  ten minutes left!

Joey:  Yeah, all right.  Ooh! 
Grandma Tribbiani: Joey!
Chandler: Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back!  Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you.  So, you're old and small.
Rachel:    Hey!
Phoebe: Did you find it?

Rachel: Okay, calm down, here they are. 
Monica:  Phoebe! 
Phoebe:  What are we going to do?!

Rachel: Ohh that'd be great!
Phoebe: Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
Monica: Yeah, what is it?

Phoebe: Yeah! You're the best!
Rachel: Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too. 
Monica:  That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!!  Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!

Rachel: Your sunglasses?!
Monica: Yes!
Phoebe: Oh, right! 
Caitlin:  Pizza!
Ross:  Oh, mine! Mine! Mine!  Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
Chandler: Okay, hold on.  Okay. 

Rachel: Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to 
Ross: You'll see. Okay.  Oh, what's-what's her name?
All: Caitlin!
Grandma Tribbiani: Caitlin!

Ross:  Was I talking to her about gas?
Chandler: More so than anything else.
Phoebe: I-I-I found it interesting.
Rachel: I'm sorry.

Ross: Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there. 
Rachel: Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes. 
Phoebe:  Ross?

Rachel: Yay!
Joey:  Hey! Is the show still on?
Chandler: Almost over man.

Monica: Not as each other! 
Phoebe: Oh, then no.
Chandler:  Hey!

Monica: Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
Joey: Oh, yeah, good idea.
Chandler: Hey man, what's up?
Ross:  Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.  

Joey:  Somebody help me out here!
Phoebe:  Hey!
Gary: Hello!
Monica: Hey!

Gary: How are you?
Phoebe: Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.
Joey: You got to go on a ride along?!

Phoebe: Uh-huh!
Joey: I want to go on a ride along!
Ross: Me too!
Gary: Okay!
Chandler: Yeah, yeah! Me too!

Ross:  He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
Gary: Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
Chandler:  Okay.  But it is officially nighttime.

Ross: It's theChandler!!
Joey:  Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
Gary: Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?

Ross: So where are we going next?
Gary: This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
Chandler: Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
Joey: Come on man!  Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?

Gary: It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
Ross: Yeah, no one talks like that!
Joey: Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!

Emily:  Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
Monica:  Nooo!
Rachel:  I know!

Monica: Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
Rachel: Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen! 
Answering Machine: Your messages have been erased.

Chandler: Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
Gary: No. But that reminds me,  sign this.
Ross: What is it?

Gary: Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
Ross: What? What? What? What is it?
Joey: Is everything okay?
Chandler: What's going on?

Gary: Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire.  Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?
Joey:  You okay man?
Ross: Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
Chandler: Uh, HELLO!!

Monica: Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
Rachel: Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Ross:  Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye! 

Gary:  Okay, go ahead.
Ross: Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
Phoebe: My God, Joey!
Chandler:  It was a car backfire!

Ross: And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Gary: Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
Chandler: Who jumps at loud noises!

Ross: I do have a newfound respect for life.
Chandler:  Oh my God! 
Gary:  So you wanna get some dinner?
Phoebe: Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.

Ross: I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Monica: Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
Chandler: Before or after you were shot by your own troops?

Gary:  Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
Phoebe: I'm fine, thanks.
Chandler:  Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
Monica: No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.

Chandler: Hiya doin' pumpkin?
Phoebe: Nope. 
Monica: So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
Gary: I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.

Monica: I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it. All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral
Gary:  I'll see you after work sweetie. 
Phoebe: Okay. Bye! 

Phoebe: I can't believe this!
Chandler:  Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
Monica: Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!

Chandler: Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! 
Phoebe: No, but it is fast. Isn't it?
Monica: Ohhhh!

Phoebe: Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him aman!
Chandler: I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
Monica: That is so sweet! 

Joey: Hey!
Rachel: Is Monica here?
Joey and Ross: No.

Rachel: Okay!  Check it out!
Ross: What-what is it?!
Joey: What the hell is that?!!

Rachel: A thousand bucks.
Ross: ON A CAT??!!!!
Joey: It's not a cat!

Rachel: All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
Ross: Free cats do that too, y'know. Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.
Joey: It's not a cat!

Rachel: Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson.  Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
Ross:  Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Joey: Uhh, the ball thing.

Ross: now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
Joey: Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
Monica:  Hey guys!

Joey: I don't know.
Monica: All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
Ross: How do you know? You don't have a watch.

Monica: What?!
Ross: Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
Joey: Yeah, we haven't dropped it in 

Monica:  I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good.   Yes!!   Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. 
Ross: Hey Rach!
Rachel: Hey.

Ross: Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Rachel: Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
Monica: Rach?

Rachel: Oh yeah, I got a cat.
Monica: I don't want a cat!
Joey: Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
Ross: Yeah.

Rachel: You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
Ross: Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
Monica:  What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!

Chandler: Im sorry.  If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Phoebe: Ohh!! God!  Ooh!  Get out of here, good for nothing.
Gary: Hey Chandler.

Chandler: Hey Gar!
Gary:  Hi sweetie.  Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
Phoebe: Yeah! Okay. 

Ross:  Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
Chandler: Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
Joey: That's right baby.

Chandler: What?
Monica: He's a dropper!
Joey: Oh yeah, that's right!

Chandler: Oh! Oh! That's so hard. 
Joey: Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
Monica: Oh myOh good God!
Rachel:  I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Ross: Baking it didn't help, huh?

Monica: So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
Rachel: I tried! They won't take her back.
Chandler: Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.

Monica: Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!!  Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
Chandler: Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
Phoebe and Gary:  Hey!
All: Hey!
Gary: We have great news!
Phoebe: We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!

All: Congratulations! Congrats!
Phoebe: I know, I'm so excited!
Gary: So am I!

Phoebe: Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
Gary: All right.
Monica: So you're moving in with him. What happened?

Ross: I'm starving! 
Monica: Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
Joey: I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We  invented this game!

Monica: Please! I made this game what it is.
Chandler: Not fun anymore?
Ross: I'm still hungry! 

Monica: Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
Rachel: It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken.  Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
Ross: Oh, thank God!
Joey: Did you get your money back?

Rachel: Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
Monica: Wow! You made a profit!
Gunther:  I just came for the red-velvet pillow.

Monica: All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
Phoebe:  Oh good, you're all up.
Rachel: Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?

Phoebe: Oh yeah, that's over.
All: What?!
Chandler: Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!

Phoebe: He shot a bird!
Chandler: Oh that is over!
All: That's terrible! I'm sorry!
Rachel: Phoebe, are you okay?

Phoebe:  Nah, I don't feel like playing. 
Monica: It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
All: All right. Okay. I'm starving! 
Rachel: Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?

Joey: Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
Rachel: Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
Ross: I know. My arm is killing me.

Ross: What's going on?
Rachel: Well, my eye is a little itchy.
Joey: Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.

Joey: All right! Thanks Pheebs!
Chandler: Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?

Joey: Oh umm, not go.

Joey: Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
Phoebe: Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!

Chandler: So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Joey: Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!

Ross: Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
Phoebe: No that made me feel precious.
Monica: Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!

Ross: Okay, I'm the baby. 
Rachel: Eh! Stop it!
Chandler:  Hey!
Monica: Chandler! What are you doing here?

Ross: Hey!

All: Why?!

Phoebe: Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross.  Or-or Rachel!
Monica:  Hello?   It's Joey.   I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Joey:  Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!

Monica: Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second. 
Phoebe: Hey, dude!
Joey: Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?

Phoebe: Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering  Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Chandler: Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Monica: Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.

Chandler: Really?
Phoebe: Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
Ross:  Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?

Joey: No!
Stanley: Eh, worth a shot.  Look Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay? 
The Grip: Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?

Ross: Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
Rachel: Yep!
Monica: Go!!

Rachel:  Sucker!
Phoebe:  Hello?  Hey Joey!
Joey: Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?

Joey: That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
Chandler:  Hey!

Phoebe:  Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
Chandler:  Is that Joey?!  Let me talk to him!
Joey: No!  Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
A Casino Boss: Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over!

Phoebe: Who was that?
Joey: Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
Chandler:  Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.

Joey: Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
Phoebe: Yeah! 
Chandler:  Hey!

Joey: Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
A Tourist:  Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Chandler: Uh, what was that?

Phoebe: On a totally different bet.
Chandler:  Hey!
Monica: It's almost our anniversary!

Chandler: Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our  anniversary.
Phoebe: Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
Monica: Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!

Phoebe: Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
Rachel: Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Ross: Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
Chandler:  Art lover!

Ross: Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. 
Rachel: Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.

Phoebe: Ah-ha! Okay,  Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back. 
Chandler:  Happy plane-aversary.
Monica: Aww! I love you!

Chandler: What Richard thing?
Phoebe:  Simmons! Go with Simmons!
Monica: Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.

Phoebe: Hey! Joey!  Hey! Hey!! Wow! 
Joey: Hi!
Chandler: Love your condoms my man.

Monica: Who are you talking too?
Joey: They uh director. Uhh, her.  All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Chandler: Why?! What happened?!

Joey: Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya.  I'm sorry man.
Chandler: No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
Monica: I knew you were not okay with that.
Phoebe: So you're a gladiator! Wow!

Joey: Dawson?! 
Phoebe: Noo! But that would've been so cool!
Chandler: No! Her boyfriend Richard!
Monica: It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?

Chandler: Thanks. 
Joey: Aww, there we go.
Phoebe: I love Vegas!
Monica: I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.

Chandler: Fine with me!
Monica: Fine! Happy Anniversary!

Monica: What are you guys gonna do?

Rachel: Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? 
Chandler: Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this ones free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third ones free.

Rachel: Oh my God! Thats so great! Im so happy for you guys! 

Monica: Yes, we are. 
Rachel: And Chandler, youre gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel cant be late.
Chandler: Rach

Ross: once you know the stories, its not that bad. First marriage, wifes hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldnt allow you to get married when youre that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevadas fault.
Phoebe: Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldnt be interested? Who wouldnt want to date him?
Stephanie: Well the divorces dont bother me, Id date him. But, not while hes still married.

Phoebe:  Whatever! What about you Meg?
Meg: Well, I dont care about the divorces either, but I wouldnt date him. Its just that hes obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
Ross: What?!

Chandler: Okay, bye! 
Monica: Rach, theres something uh, important I have to tell you.
Rachel:  Are you pregnant?!

Joey: Yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Chandler: Not once did we do that.
Monica:  Hi.

Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Hi.
Monica: So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.

Chandler: And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?
Monica: I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Dont I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Joey: Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! Its like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channies!! 

Chandler:  Hey!
Phoebe: Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes! 
Joey:  Dude! What are yoyou trying to kill me?!
Rachel:  Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.

Phoebe: Yes, Denise. Denise! 
Joey: Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
Chandler: Pheebs, I dont understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?

Phoebe: Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
Joey: Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin uh, Im gonna have an extra room over at my place
Rachel: Oh, thats true.

Joey: I dont know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez! 
Monica: Okay listen, yknow when you move in Rachels room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Chandler: Sure!

Rachel: Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this;  "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Its just, there is nothing! The citys full!
Phoebe: Wait, no, look at this!   "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay" Oh, yeah, but its on the ground floor.
Ross:  Hey!

Rachel: Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now!  Oh, thank you!

Rachel: I would love to live with you Ross; thats-thats great! Thank you!
Ross: Well, Im-Im just glad I could, yknow, help you out.
Phoebe: Wow! Im-Im so happy for you guys.  This is so-so, not stupid.

Ross:  Okay-okay! Two very good points, look Ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you onemillionth as happy as youve been since youve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Chandler: Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
Monica: Love is the best medicine.

Chandler: Yeah, I do.
Ross: And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, dont ya?
Monica: Yes.

Gunther: I dont know.
Ross:  Hey Rach!
Rachel: Hi!

Ross: So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean its a really big step! And-and whats the rush?!
Monica: Thats very funny!
Chandler: Hes being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!

Ross: Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isnt about the room, this is about what the roomrepresents! And unfortunately, this room  could destroy you!!
Chandler: Yeah, I'm not so worried.
Monica: Yeah, no, me neither.

Ross: Fine! Its your life!  I just dont want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together,  but thats what you want, theres nothing I can do.  DONT DO IT!!!!! 
Monica: You still want to move in together right?
Chandler: Of course!

Phoebe: Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
Ross:  So umm, where are the other guys?
Rachel: Umm, well lets see Monica and Chandler are occupied.

Ross: Is that what I want?
Phoebe:  Yes.
Joey: Here she comes. Hold on, Im gonna make your life much easier.
Rachel: All right, well the place was closed. Ill just copy it later.

Rachel: What?!
Ross:  You complete me kitchen, matey!
Phoebe: Ross, I know what youre thinking.

Ross:  Uh-oh, saved by the bell.  Hello?
Monica: Hey Rach, arent these candlesticks  mine?
Rachel: No-no, I bought those.

Monica: Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
Ross: Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it. 
Rachel: Well, who wouldnt?!

Ross: I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean its temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
Phoebe: Yeah, Professor and Mrs.
Rachel: And Mrs.?!

Chandler: Hey!
Phoebe: Hi.
Monica: Hey!

Chandler: What?!
Phoebe: Yeah, and I know you guys dont know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
Monica: Phoebe thats crazy!
Joey: I cant believe she would say that too you.
Rachel: Yeah honey you dont believe her do you?

Phoebe: No, cause she didnt tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean Ive only got a week left, yknow? Ive really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)
Ross:  Hey everyone!
Chandler: Oh hi!

Ross:  Okay!
All: Ohh! Were kidding! Oh, were kidding!
Rachel: Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?

Ross: Thank you!
Rachel: Some uh, some visual aides.
Joey: Oh-ooh-ooh! Yknow whats a good visual aide?

Phoebe: Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, yknow if you can.
Rachel: Monica!
Monica: Hmm? 

Rachel: Yeah.  Nice try! 
Ross:  Hello!
Monica: Hey!

Rachel: Hey!
Monica: Howd the lecture go?
Ross: It went great! And I didnt need any jokes or naked chicks either!

Rachel: Wow, thats great Ross, Im sorry we werent more supportive before.
Ross: I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyones all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, Im gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
Monica: That youre not funny or sexy?

Monica: What the hell are you doing?!
Ross: Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
Rachel: Yeah, and not a very good one.

Chandler: I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and lets just get that thingpushed back in.
Joey: Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I dont want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, Im thinking Ill probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
Phoebe: Hey!

Chandler: Hey.
Joey: Hey!
Phoebe: Whats going on?

Chandler: Oh Joeys got a really bad hernia, but thats nothing a little laser eye surgery wont fix!
Joey: Look, Im telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here  it doesnt hurt that bad.
Phoebe: Hey! Maybe youll die!

Monica: You just wanna each take one?
Rachel: Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Ross:  Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?

Monica: Yes!
Rachel: Okay!   "Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, wed like you to come on board with us full time! 
Phoebe:  Hey!

Chandler: Now, is that never talking about it again?!
Joey:  Hiya!
The Director: Hey Joey, were ready for ya!  Joey, this is Alex hes going to be playing your son.

A Crew Member: Take 36 is up!
The Director: All right! Lets try this again! You ready Joe?
Joey: Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?

Phoebe: Hey!
Joey: Hey-hey-hey!
Chandler: What are you doing?

Rachel: When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didnt get the annulment; we are still married.
Chandler: What?
Monica: Youre kidding!
Phoebe:  Oh my God!!

Monica: Ross!
Ross: Okay, maybe it wasnt my best decision. But I just couldnt face another failed marriage.
Chandler: Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?

Joey: Great! Thanks. 
Phoebe:  Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
Monica: Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
Chandler:  Yeah, all right.

Phoebe:  Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and Im nervous cause Ive never done that before by myself!
Monica: Dont worry about it Phoebe, well absolutely do it.
Chandler: Yeah, Im gonna pass. Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.

Guy 1: Nice car!
Joey: Yeah, its not mine.
Woman:  I love your car.

Monica: Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, its going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
Chandler: Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben.  Do you know what Pheebs? When youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. 
Phoebe: Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.

Chandler: Okay, Im a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
Monica: This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
Phoebe: Yeah?  Well this is not what I ordered.
Joey:  Hey guys!

Chandler: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Joey: Hey babies! Oh, Im having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche Ive got the keys too, still there!

Chandler: What equity investments?
Joey: The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up!  But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, theyre gonna start to think that I dont own it. So I figured Ill wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
Monica: Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.

Phoebe: I dont know why I was so nervous about this. And I dont know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Monica: Yeah, two hours, a lifetime thats the same.
Chandler:  Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog! 

Monica: Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someones eye out!
Chandler: He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
Phoebe: No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, thats just gonna mess them up.

Chandler: Glass, sand, whatever. 
Phoebe: Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
Monica: Oh its so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.

Phoebe: Oh, I can still do that.
Monica: How are you still single?!
Chandler:  All right.  I thought about it and maybe youre right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.

Monica: Good. What made you change your mind?
Chandler: I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
Phoebe: How did that happen?!!

Judge: And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
Ross: What?!
Rachel: Uh yes, heroin and crack.

Ross: Crack isnt even an intravenous drug!
Rachel: Well, you would know.
Judge: Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?

Ross: Oh, come on!
Rachel:  Ross, please, I found the magazines!
Judge: And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since youre gay and addicted to heroin.

Ross: And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
Rachel: Ugh!
Judge: Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.

Rachel: Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
Judge: Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly dont qualify for an annulment. If you two dont want to be together youll have to file for divorce.
Ross:  Thats great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!

Rachel: All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
Ross: Yeah!
Judge: Would you like to spend the night in jail?

Joey: Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! Right?
Chandler: That is true.
Phoebe: Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.

Joey: Come on! What are you doing?! Im in character! Would you talk to her! 
Chandler: Ahh, I think it just moved. Its really poking me.
Monica: All right, thats it, were going to the emergency room.
Phoebe: What?! No, you cant, you cant leave me here with them! Were baby-sitting! 

Monica: Hes got something plastic lodged in his throat, weve got to go to the hospital.
Phoebe: But no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
Chandler: I think thats gum.

Joey:  Porsche.
Rachel: This is totally your fault!
Ross: My fault?! You threatened the judge!

Rachel: Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporters machine!!
Ross: That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Joey: Hi! How are the Gellers? 

Phoebe: Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed em, bathed em, and put em to bed.
Chandler: And protected them from a tornado?
Monica: Oh my God.

Phoebe: I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
Monica: But my apartment!
Chandler: Was the setting of Phoebes triumph.

Phoebe: Why dont you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
Chandler: Well that would help the pride thing.
Monica:  Hey!

Chandler: Okay!  So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Monica: Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought wed go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
Phoebe: And also, my birthday.

Monica: Its not your birthday.
Phoebe: What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you its not your birthday!
Joey: Hey!
Ross: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!

Phoebe: Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
Chandler: Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure wed do nothing.
Ross: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
Joey: I dont know Ross, not if youre gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.

Ross: I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
Rachel:  Pheebs, I was wondering
Monica: Youre not dressed yet?! Were supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!

Phoebe: Well, what youre wearing is fine for that.
Monica:  Rachel, I need to borrowYoure not packed!!!! Youre not packed even a little bit!
Rachel: Surprise!!

Monica: Why not?
Joey:  Ive got Ben.
Ross: Because, because Ive got Ben.

Rachel: Im sorry Pheebs, I guess Im just really said that Im leaving.
Monica: Im gonna miss you so much.
Phoebe: Well, this doesnt have to be so sad though. Yknow? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much youre gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things youre not gonna miss.

Monica: Nope, shes perfect.
Rachel: I have one.
Phoebe: Good! Great! You can go first.

Rachel: Uh well, I guess Im not gonna miss the fact that youre never allowed to move the phone pen. 
Phoebe: Good thats a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Yknow? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
Monica: Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.

Phoebe: Okay, good. There you go. Doesnt anyone feel better?
Monica: Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
Rachel: You get your messages!

Phoebe: Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
Rachel: You know what else Im not gonna miss? "Im Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
Monica: "Hi Im Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, Id better wash it and shrink it!"

Rachel: "Im Monica, I dont get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
Phoebe: Hey! I call her!
Monica: "Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"

Monica: How about, youre moving!! 
Rachel: Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! 
Phoebe: Hey, how are you guys doing?

Rachel: Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! 
Phoebe: Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know whats going on here. Okay, you guys STOP!!  I know that, I know that youre acting mad because you think that itll make it easier to leave. But deep down youre still really sad. Deep-deep down.
Monica: No Phoebe I am mad!

Monica: Well, this is the last box of your clothes. Im just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Rachel: Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Phoebe: Hey you guys, I dont mean to make things worse, but umm, I dont want to live with Rachel anymore.
Monica and Rachel: What?!

Phoebe: Youre just so mean to each other! And I dont want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Rachel: Well, Phoebe thats fine because Im not moving.
Monica: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Yknow I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but yknow Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.

Rachel: Yeah and you stretch em out with your big old clown feet.
Monica: Do you wanna live outside?! Because its gettin cold!  She gets tons of catalogs and umm, shell fold down the pages of the things she thinks that Id like.
Phoebe: What else?

Monica: When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Rachel: Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
Phoebe: Thats nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.

Monica: And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive.   You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! 
Rachel: Oh, its gonna be fine.
Phoebe: Okay Rachel, I cant wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! Well have so much fun!!

Rachel: Bye Mon.
Monica: Bye.
Chandler:  Hey.

Ross: So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
Chandler:  And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
Monica: Hey!
Ross and Chandler: Hey!

Monica: Oh, So you can move them!
Chandler: Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you. 
Joey: Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
Janine: Hi.
Ross: Hi! 

Janine: Hi
Joey: Yeah, she's gonna live with me!
Monica: It's nice to meet you. Janine...?

Janine: Lecroix. Janine Lecroix
Joey: I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
Chandler: So, uh, wh-where ya from?

Janine: Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
Joey:  From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
Ross: So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?

Janine: Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
Joey: Oh, hey let me. 
Monica: Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?

Joey: "When can you move in?"
Ross: Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Chandler: Unbelievable
Monica: Oh, so you like her too Chandler?

Chandler: Hey, look at all the boxes!
Joey: Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Monica: Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated. 
Ross: Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.

Chandler: No-no
Joey: Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
Monica: Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.

Rachel: Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
Monica: Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Ross: Yeah.

Rachel: You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
Phoebe: Hey!
Ross: Hey!

Rachel: Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
Phoebe: Why? Why would you do that?
Monica: I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.

Ross: Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freakout. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
Chandler: No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now.  Phone's done ehh.
Monica:  Hi!

Chandler: Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Joey:  Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame!  What the hell's going on over here?!?!?  Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time. 
Ross: Hey, I've been married 3 times

Joey: No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Ross: Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Chandler: Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?

Ross: Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
Chandler: That's not specific to girls.
Joey: This is great, this is great, what else, what else?

Chandler:  No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
Monica: What?!
Ross:  What?!

Chandler:  I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
Ross: Why does anyone have to be naked?
Monica: Why is Ross naked?

Ross: Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
Monica: Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Chandler: Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.

Monica: Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
Chandler: Bye! Thank God
Ross: Dude, what'd you have?

Monica: Why is everything different?
Ross: Bye! 
Chandler: No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. 

Monica: It was okay. Shes still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Chandler: Ohh, yeah.
Ross: Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?

Monica: No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
Ross: Still I could tell. She was into me.  Well, why dont you set us up?
Rachel: Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
Phoebe:  Hey.

Rachel: But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesnt see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesnt like me very much.
Chandler: Thats weird. I dont think my boss likes me either.
Monica: I dont think mine likes me either.
Ross: Maybe its a universal thing?
Joey: Or maybe, its because youre hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday. 

Ross: Whats up? 
Chandler: You knowOh My God.
Monica: What happened to your teeth.

Ross: Come on, seriously.
Monica: Ross theyre really, really, really white.
Chandler: Yeah, what was wrong with your oldhuman teeth.

Ross: I know. Thats why I did it.  Come on, are they really that bad?
Chandler: No, no no no. Youll be fine.  Hillarys bind, right?
Monica: She will be after tonight.

Chandler: Yeah. 
Ross: Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh
Rachel: Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside.  You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.

Chandler: What???
Monica: Oh my god.
Rachel: Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they justmade out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip shed heard all year.

Chandler: Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish. 
Phoebe: Hey. Here.  Ohh, whos the silver fox?
Rachel: That-that is your make out buddy. Dont you recognize him?  Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.

Rachel: I-I dont want your job. I-I dont. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I dont even know how to use my keycard. 
Kim: Hi Ralph.
Ralph Lauren:: Hi Kim. 

Joey: So whats really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Monica: Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Chandler: Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.

Monica: Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because Im going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Joey: Ohh, I love birds. 
Chandler: What is the matter with you ?!?

Rachel:  Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I cant do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I cant do this. Im married and Im sorry." And then I dont know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."
Kim: You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.
Ralph Lauren:: Hi Kim. 

Chandler: Hey.
Janine: Hey guys!
Ross:  No I dont want to play video games, Joey!

Janine: No, but you should go to Chandlers. Because none of us knows how to cook, well probably just end up drinking all day.
Joey: Ye-ye, we go to yours!
Ross: Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because its my sister. But, uh, uh yknow actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.

Phoebe: Hey!
All: Hey!
Rachel: Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!

Phoebe: Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachels dessert is...about to say bad so good that I eat all of it. Theres none left for anybody else!
Monica: Nothing.
Rachel:  Nothing?

Monica: Well, its done about two minutes before it looks like that.
Joey and Ross: Hey!
All: Hey!
Joey: Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
Ross: And the place looks so nice!

Joey: Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
Ross: Happy Thanksgiving!
The Girls: Happy Thanksgiving!

Joey: Well, this has been great!
Ross: See ya!
Monica: Whoa whoa whoa! Wherere you goin?

Ross: Some would say shes attractive, yes.
Phoebe: And who else is going to be there?
Joey: Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
Rachel: Her dancer friends?

Joey:  Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and theyre gonna be, be drinkin and dancin, and we really wanna go!
Ross:  Dude, we were good!
Monica: Youre not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and youre gonna eat here!
Phoebe: Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.

Ross: Oh, but-but it is, uh, its just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Joey: Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
Mrs. Geller: Hello everybody!
Mr. Geller: Hi!
All: Hi!
Monica: Dad kisses Jack, Mom kisses Judy. Look! Look who it is its Chandler!

Mr. Geller: My joke wasnt funny.
Phoebe: Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
Rachel: Really?!

Phoebe: Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And its making me look at him totally differently. Yknow, I mean he used to be just, yknow Jack Geller Monica and Rosss dad and now hes hes Jack Geller, dream hunk."
Rachel: I dunno. Yknow to me hell always be Jack Geller, walks in while youre changing.
Monica: Yknow dad, Chandler is one of Rosss very best friends!
Chandler: Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, yknow Ive always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
Mr. Geller: I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?

Chandler:  Hes the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
Joey: Rach, youre killin us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting! 
Rachel:  Look at it, isnt it beautiful?
Ross: Yeah, yeah, what is it?

Rachel:  And while Im gone dont you boys sneak a taste.
Joey and Ross:  Okay.
Ross: Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
Joey: I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?

Ross: Yeah, itll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
Joey:  Vomiting stories are funny...
Rachel: Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!

Joey:  Still not hot enough!
Phoebe: Rachel?
Rachel: Yeah?

Phoebe: Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldnt give to be that can of  condensed milk.
Monica: Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
Mrs. Geller: Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
Chandler: Oh, yes. Well its very beautiful. Its cream-colored and tight Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked. Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look. I dont mean tight, I mean its not too tight, not that I was looking at-giving up all hope, he puts his head into his hands.
Mr. Geller: Whats the matter with him?

Monica: Ross, I cant believe youd do that!
Chandler: The reason we havent told them were together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Ross: Okay, okay, Ill tell em it wasnt Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?

Monica: Dad, please dont pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if youre gonna put your feet up, why dont you sit on the-
Phoebe: Monica, leave him alone!
Joey:  Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janines friends are dancers?! And that theyre going to be drinking alot!?
Rachel:  No, I did, but tell me again, because its so romantic.

Rachel: So why dont you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
Joey: Oh I am!
Monica: Ross, if you dont tell them, then I will!
Ross: Okay, fine!

Joey: Just kiddin, Ill talk to them, you distract Rach.
Ross: Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
Rachel: Okay...

Rachel: No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean youre pity-tone alone, alone. And I just-its just not the time for us. Im sorry.
Ross:  Ah well, cant blame a guy for trying!
Joey: Oh and  Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach  or uh, or saying mmm and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
Chandler: Yeah, Im not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.

Joey:  Really?
Rachel: No, Im just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, its trifle time!
Phoebe: So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isnt it?

Rachel: Really? How good? 
Monica: Its so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one whos eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
All:  Mmm.
Chandler:  Yeah, this is so good, that Im gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
Mrs. Geller:  Ive gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monicas room.
Mr. Geller:  Ill help you dial.

Monica:  Im gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
Rachel: Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
Ross: Wha? No no! Ah!   All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.

Ross: Are you kidding?
Joey: Whats not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
Rachel: ...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
Chandler:  Yes, but if its any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
Phoebe: Rachel, come here.  Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.

Rachel:  Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
Phoebe: Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
Mr. Geller: Boy, Im glad I wore the big belt today.

Phoebe: Five minutes ago, a line like that wouldve floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
Monica: Ross? Lets go.
Ross: Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.

Monica:  Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
Mr. and Mrs. Geller: What?!
Ross:   You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?

Mr. and Mrs. Geller: Yes. 
Ross: Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. Im sorry.
Mrs. Geller: It was you?
Monica: And Dad, yknow that mailman that you got fired? He didnt steal your Playboys! Ross did!

Ross: Monica and Chandler are living together!
Monica: Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
Phoebe:  I love Jacques Cousteau!
Rachel:  I wasnt supposed to put beef in the trifle!
Joey:  I wanna gooooooo!
Mrs. Geller:  Thats alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you werent supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, Im sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead.  Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
Mr. Geller: And we kinda figured about the porch swing.

Mrs. Geller: Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?
Mr. Geller: What happened son?
Ross: I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!

Mrs. Geller: Chandler! Youve been Rosss best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems.  And now youve taken on Monica as well. Well, I dont know what to say. Youre a wonderful human being.
Chandler: Thank you!
Mr. Geller: No! Thank you!  Monica, and Ross! I dont know what Im gonna do about the two of you!

Rachel: You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldnt feel bad!
Monica: Well actually, I-I didnt eat mine. Its still in the bathroom.
Joey: No it isnt, I ate that.
Mrs. Geller:  Well we left ours in Monicas bedroom.

Chandler: Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
Rachel: Thats a good story, Grandpa.
Ross: Hey
All: Hey

Ross: Wow, Monicas letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
Monica: Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. Its about being with the people that you love.
Phoebe: That is nice and were done. TADA!
Chandler: I dunno what it is, it just doesnt quite feel like Christmas to me.

Ross:  and thats the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising lifes triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
Rachel: So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
Joey: Hey you guys.
Chandler: Hey Joe whats up?

Joey: I know. And shes so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
Chandler: You are aware that shes not a monkey, right?
Ross: I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now shes like OLD NEWS!
Janine: Hey guys!

Ross: Hi Janine!
Janine: I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Years Eve. Its called some sort of Dickn Rockn Dickie Eve.
Monica: Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clarks New Years Rocking Eve?

Janine: Yeah, thats what I said.
Monica: Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
Chandler: Ah, youre still just a little fat girl inside arent you? 

Janine: Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?
Ross: Are you serious?
Monica: We are there!
Chandler: What, what are you laughing at?
Rachel: Well, I used to date him, but youre still going out with her!

Janine: Thanks.  Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!
All: Bye!
Ross: Bye Janine!
Joey: Did she just ask me out on a date?
Chandler: I dont think so.
Monica: What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Rachel: Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, Im sorry, but I dont think that was a romantic thing.

Joey: Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. Were going to a New Years Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Yknow? But if she says Dude, what the hell are you doing? I can say It wasnt me, it was New Years!
Rachel: Well, thats a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
Ross: It was a dry day.
Monica: We are going to Dick Clarks New Years Rocking Eve!

Ross: Oh my God its just like I dreamed it!
Director: OK, everyone gather up.
Monica and Ross: Scuse us

Rachel: Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Chandler: I can save you time ladies, Im right here.
Phoebe: Yeah, Chandler why dont you take a walk? This doesnt concern you.

Rachel: We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Chandler: What? Thats terrible!
Phoebe: No-no, we do it every year!

Chandler: Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
Phoebe: No, yeah, we never find them! Shes always best at us that wily minx.
Rachel: Dont worry, were just gonna search here for an hour, them were gonna go over to Joeys and search, OK?

Chandler: No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Phoebe: Oh, thats it?  A great idea!
Rachel: Chandler, thats not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And youve just gotten her one great present? I mean thats just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?

Chandler: If I help, we can find em faster!
Rachel: Thats right!
Phoebe: Ooh ooh, we have a live one!

Rachel: Yeah.
Chandler: You dont, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
Phoebe and Rachel: No, we never do that

Ross: Hey, whatd you guys do to get up on there?
Girl: We learned how to dance.
Monica: Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?

Ross: Yeah!
Janine: Hey! Youre a good dancer!
Joey: Really?

Janine: Thats it, feel the rhythm. Thats better.
Joey: Uh-huh.
Director:  Okay, youre dancing with that girl over there.

Chandler: I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Rachel: Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
Phoebe: Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!

Chandler: Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
Phoebe: Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
Rachel: Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?

Chandler: Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
Phoebe: Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz. 
Rachel: Ha!

Joey: Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just..  Here we go.  Looking good Gellers!
Ross: We know!
Monica: Hey, see that snippy guy over there? Hes the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.

Monica: 5 6 7 8!
Ross: So, do we really have to ask whos going up on the platform next?
Director: Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!

Monica: Yes! 
Director:  Make sure you get this, theyre gonna want it for the bloopers show.  Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again its gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybodys excitement.
Tall Guy: Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.

Director: Whats the matter with you? Get out of here!
Joey: Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
Ross: Can you believe this? Were gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
Monica: I know! Hey, you havent been practising the routine, have you?

Ross: Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, yknow? 
Monica: Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we dont wanna look stupid!
Director: Alright were back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! 
Joeys Head: Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.
All: Three, Two, One!

Phoebe: And the big ones for me!
Rachel: Ooh, lets open them!
Chandler: Okay! Okay! Okay!

Phoebe: Hee hee!
Chandler: Wait, we cant do this.
Phoebe and Rachel: Why?

Joey: Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
Monica: Honey, we have been through this before!
Rachel: Yeah. Dont do this to yourself.
Phoebe: Shes made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.

Joey: Well all right then, I guess I shouldnt get to excited about the fact  that I just kissed her!
Monica: You serious?!
Chandler: Thats great!

Monica: Really?!
Phoebe: Yeah well, well see.
Ross: You kissed her.
Joey: Oh we kissed it up real nice.
Chandler: So you kissed her, so what happened after that?

Janine:  Bye.
Monica: Bye. 
Joey: Have you kissed her yet? Its awesome! I could do it forever! Yknow what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!

Monica: I am so glad you said cooks.
Rachel: I know.
Chandler:  Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff. 

Rachel: Yeah! Its an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
Chandler: A pharmacist. 
Monica: Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
Joey: I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!

Chandler: You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
Joey:  I was tired!
Rachel: Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Monica: Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.

Rachel: Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
Monica: Its gotta be one of a kind. Yknow like umm, yknow uh, whats that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Joey: Hey! I made that for her!
Chandler: You made pottery?

Chandler: Look at us, were a couple of couples!
Janine: I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
Monica: Yeah.
Joey: And Chandler I cant believe I let you pay for this one.  Thanks man.

Monica: So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? Ill make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
Janine: Oh that would be great!
Joey: Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.

Monica: Joey, you dont have too!
Joey: Nope-op! I insist!  You get the wine right?
Chandler: Yeah all right.  Okay, good night guys.

Joey: See ya tomorrow!
Monica: Tomorrow!
Janine: Cant wait! 

Rachel: Ross, shes not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
Ross: Huh. Yknow whats not one of a kind? A twin!
Phoebe:  Hey!

Rachel: Ooh, Phoebes here! Okay, lets turn out all the lights and well just watch the movie!
Phoebe: Okay. HeyOoh, cool sheets!  
Ross: Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it? 

Monica: The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
Chandler: And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight.  You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldnt afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
Joey: Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually its just gonna be me again tonight.

Monica: What happened to Janine?
Joey: Oh, shes uh-uh really sick.
Chandler: Oh thats too bad.

Joey: Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
Monica:  What?!!  What?
Chandler: So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!

Monica: Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
Chandler: And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
Joey: I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, dont-dont be mad. Im sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Yknow? And it was our first date! Plus, shes really sick!

Chandler: Eh, theyre both good. I generally just go with, Monicas drunk again.  
Joey: Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? Shell come around I promise.
Monica: Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.

Chandler: Okay.
Monica:  I do not like that woman!
Joey:  I can hear you!

All: Aww! 
Rachel: Thats funny. 
Ross: Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my newold sheet?
Phoebe: Oh sure!  Noo!

Rachel: Ohh!!
Ross: My apothecary table!!!
Phoebe: What?!

Rachel: Noooooo!!  
Phoebe: Ross, where did you get this?!
Ross: I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!

Rachel: Oh yes.
Phoebe: Well this doesnt even smell like opium.
Ross: Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.

Chandler: Perfect decibel.
Monica:  I know!!!
Joey:  Hey!

Chandler: Oh nothing, were just talking. Yknow, blah-blah-blah.
Joey: Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
Monica: Well, Id like to but,  Im not sure we have time to go.

Rachel: I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Ross: A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Phoebe:  Hey!

Rachel: Hey.
Phoebe:  Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
Ross:  Fascinating.

Phoebe: Ah!
Ross: Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel? 
Rachel: Well theres yore. And uh, yknow, yesteryear.

Phoebe: Oh, come on! I think hes ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Ross: Really?!  Hey, yknow what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, heres-heres 60 bucks, why dont you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
Rachel:  Yknow what? I dont, I dont think Phoebe really wants to come.

Phoebe: No! I do want to!
Rachel: Oh, she does want to.
Ross: She does want to.

Joey: Well, this-this-this was great. Didnt everybody have a great time?
Janine: Well I did. I really did. And you guys, Ive got to say, Im sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
Chandler: Thats totally understandable.
Monica: Dont worry about it.

Janine: So we can go out again?
Chandler: Oh yeah!
Monica: Absolutely!

Janine: Oh good.
Joey: Oh well then, good night!
Monica: Good night! 

Joey: See? Eh, wasnt that fun?
Janine: We have got to move!
Monica:  I knew it!! Yknow, youre not so quiet yourself, missy!
Chandler: And Im blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it,  "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."

Janine: Yknow, I know youre talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
Monica:  All right! You and me! Lets go! Right now!
Joey: All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough!  You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! 
Chandler:  Yknow I think you can take her.

Monica:  Youd better hope I dont see you in the hallway!! 
Joey: All right, uh, weve got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you cant treat them that way.
Janine: They said stuff to me too, yknow!

Joey: Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. 
Monica: What did I tell you about the hall?!
Janine: I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! Id really like it if we could be friends.

Monica:  Youd better run! 
Chandler: Did you hear that?
Joey: Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?

Ross: Hey!
Joey: How ya doin?
Chandler: Hey so, did uh, did she move out?

Ross: What?
Rachel: Im sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny. 
Chandler: Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
Monica: No.

Chandler: Seriously?
Monica: Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
Ross: Look, Chandler, its my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they dont print the name, so it doesnt really matter who gets credit, right?

Phoebe: Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
Monica: So do you think that these picturesAre, are they trying to tell a story?
Rachel: Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, shes crying out, Where are they, where are they?

Monica: Well, shes not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Phoebe: Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
Rachel and Monica: Yeah.
Rachel: You see, now, I would date this girl. Shes cute, shes outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, thats got to come in handy

Joey: You forget how many great songs Heart had.
Chandler: Yeah.
Ross: You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.

Chandler: So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
Joey: Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but Im not even sure I got it.
Ross: What, you didnt get it? The doctor is a monkey.

Chandler: Okay .
Gunther:  Here you go.
Joey: Ah, Gunther, I cant pay for this right now because Im not working, so Ive had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin for stuff.

Monica: That is completely untrue. You think Im high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and were going to go through it point by point!
Phoebe: No, okay, youre right. Youre easy-going. Youre just not as easy-going as Rachel. Shes just more flexible and-and mellow. Thats all.
Rachel:  Well, people are different.

Phoebe: Oh, okay,  youre not a pushover.
Rachel: Oh my  you think Im a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? Youre not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think thats pretty strong, thats what I think. Come on, Monica, lets go to lunch. 
Monica:  You start working on that list. 

Ross:  Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
Gunther: Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up. 
Joey: Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause Im heading up there.

Ross: Uh, yeah, Ill take a coffee. Thanks, man.
Joey: Sure.  Coffee? Cause Im going up there. 
Rachel: No.
Monica: No, thank you.

Monica: Joey, whats going on. What didnt you tell us you work here?
Joey: Its kind of embarrassing, yknow. I mean, I was an actor and now Im a waiter. Its supposed to go in the other direction.
Chandler: So is your apron. Youre wearing it like a cape.

Joey: I mean, the jobs easy and the moneys good, you know? I guess Im going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
Rachel: Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Ross: Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?

Joey: See, now its weird again.
Chandler: I think its great that you work here. Youre going to make a lot of money, and heres your first tip: Dont eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
Rachel: Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right.  A smile goes a long way.  And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.

Rachel: Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
Phoebe: Okay.
Monica: So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?

Rachel: Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
Monica: Hah!
Phoebe: That true, I am flaky.

Rachel: So, what, youre just, youre just okay with being flaky?
Phoebe: Yeah, totally.
Monica: Well, then, Im okay with being high maintenance.

Rachel: Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
Phoebe: Thats great. Good for you guys.
Monica: I am not high maintenance!

Rachel: I am not a pushover!
Phoebe: Who said you were?
Monica and Rachel: You did!

Ross: Its my joke.
Chandler: Its my joke.
Ross and Chandler: Its my joke.

Ross: Monica! 
Chandler: Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
Monica: Why do I have to decide?

Chandler: Because youre the only one that can be fair.
Ross: Yeah.
Monica: I cant be fair. Youre my boyfriend.

Ross: Well each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truthme. 
Monica: Okay, Chandler, you go first.
Chandler: Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.

Monica: Continue.
Chandler: So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steves doctors name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, Doctor Monkey? And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. 
Ross: Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, Im a doctor, and I had a monkey. Im Doctor Monkey!

Monica: Hey, its Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why dont you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Chandler:  Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady.  Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail andgenerosity of spirit.
Rachel: Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think Ive ever heard.
Phoebe: Really? Ive heard better.

Monica:  Phoebe, its okay that you dont want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
Phoebe:  Yknow, suddenly I find you very attractive.
Chandler: Hey, buddy boy, howd the audition go?
Joey: Not good, no. I didnt get the part, and I lost my job here, so 

Phoebe: Wow! That is a bad audition.
Rachel: How-how did you lose your job here?
Joey: Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.

Phoebe: Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
Monica: I pick you, Phoebe.
Rachel: Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.

Phoebe: Yeah, well, I kinda thought.
Chandler: Hey.
Rachel: Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
Ross: No way. 
Joey: Im not answering that.

Joey: Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together thats  $12.75.
Chandler: This coming from the man who couldnt split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
Woman: Hi!

Joey: It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! Im getting more dates than ever!
Rachel: Wait a minute, youre only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
Phoebe: Yeah Joey that is so gross!

Ross: Hey!
Chandler: Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldnt you be at work?
Monica:  Ugh, they sent me home. They said I cant work if Im sick.
All: Ohh!

Chandler: Im so sorry youre sick.
Monica: Im not sick!! I dont get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies! 
Rachel: Honey, no one thinks youre a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue. 

Monica: Im fine-d. Im fine-d! Yknow, its a really hard word to say.
Chandler: Yes?
Woman: Hi, is Rachel here? Im her sister.
Rachel: Oh my God, Jill!
Jill: Oh my God, Rachel!

Chandler: Oh my God, introduce us!
Rachel: This is Chandler. 
Jill: Hi!

Rachel: Dont!!   Honey, what are you doing here?!
Phoebe:  Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or thats bitter?
Jill:  Daddy cut me off.

Phoebe: Never mind, I got it.
Jill: And yknow what I said to him? "Im gonna hire a lawyer and Im gonna sue you and take all your money. Then Im gonna cut you off!"
Rachel: Wow! What did he say?

Jill: That he wouldnt pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter hes actually proud off.
Rachel: Oh! Did you hear that?! My dads proud of me! My dads proud of me.
Monica: Rach? 

Rachel: Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
Jill: Okay, I bought a boat.
Monica: You bought a boat?

Jill: Yeah but it wasnt for me, it was for a friend.
Chandler: Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! 
Rachel: Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that couldve ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! Im the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what youre gonna do. Youre gonna get a job, youre gonna get an apartment, and then Ill help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?
Phoebe: Of course, yeah!

Joey:  Sorry! 
Jill:  I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy. 
Ross: Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.

Jill: So who made her queen of the world?
Phoebe: I would love that job!
Rachel:  Hey! Whats goin on?

Jill: No! They did! 
Phoebe and Ross: Yeah, we went shopping!
Rachel: You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jills nose when you know shes trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!
Phoebe: Sorry Jill.
Ross: Sorry-sorry Jill.

Ross: Its a rug. 
Rachel: Jill?
Jill:  Im sorry Rachel, Im sorry

Rachel: All right, its okay. One little setback is okay, just dont let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But Im just gonna take the-the pajmena.  And the uh, and the uh pants. Yknow what, Im just gonna take it all away, cause that way youll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, Im gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. 
Jill: She took all my stuff.
Ross: Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one. 

Joey: Yeah, not it here it isnt.
Jill:  Sorry Im late, whats up?
Rachel:  Oh hi! Yknow, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.

Joey: Damnit! 
Ross:  Rach? Hi!
Rachel: Hi!

Jill: Hey!
Ross: Hi .
Rachel: Rachel.

Joey: Whoa, I didnt know we could date your sister!
Monica: Joey we know you steal our food.
Chandler: Im good.

Monica:  Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Rachel: Yeah. And yknow who shouldve shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
Chandler:  Is that a swing?

Rachel: Oh dont even ask!
Chandler: Yuck!
Joey: I cant believe Ross went out with Rachels sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.

Phoebe: Oh yknow whats sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
Chandler:  Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
Joey:  You didnt cry when Bambis mother died?

Chandler: Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, Im rich!
Monica: Oh, Ive got it! I have got it!  Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
Phoebe: All right, whats going on there? 

Chandler: Oh they didnt want to come!
Phoebe: Oh Chandler!
Monica: Poor thing!

The Fan: Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think youre really talented.
Phoebe: Youre just saying that because youre my biggest fan.   Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay?  Hes a fan.  Bye! 
Joey:  So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?

Rachel: No.
Monica:  Oh great! Did you get a movie?
Joey: Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I dont think its the kind youre gonna like.
Chandler: You didnt get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?

Joey:  Phoebes a porn star!
All: What?!!
Chandler: Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer.
Rachel: Oh my God!
Monica: Thats Phoebe! Where did you get that?

Joey: Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
Ross: And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didnt know he was in there. 
Rachel: Wow! I mean, I justI cant, I cant believe this. Yknow, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe whos always been somewhat of a question mark.
Monica: This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, yknow she had such a terrible childhood.
Chandler: Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I dont do porn.

Monica:  Yknow maybe a little bit!
Rachel: Probably just the first half.
Joey: No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebes our friend! Well, Im not gonna watch it!
Ross: Yeah! Good for you Joe!

Joey: Yeah.
Buffay, the Vampire Layer: Ah, I thought Id find you here, Nasforatool.
The Vampire: Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?

Buffay, the Vampire Layer: Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
Monica: Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Chandler: Her ankle is what youre watching?
Rachel: Well its hard to tell  Oh God, if she would just stop moving.

Chandler: Shes just doing her job!
Joey:  You sick bastards!
Rachel: Oh, its a tattoo! Thats weird, Phoebe doesnt Wait thats Ursula! Thats not Phoebe that is Ursula!

Ross: Ohh!
Rachel: Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I cant find her anywhere.
Monica: No, I havent.

Ursula: No Im not.
Mans Voice: Were still rolling!
Phoebe: Youre making one right now!
Another Mans Voice: Lets go Phoebe!

Phoebe: And-and youre using my name!
Ursula: Yeah, can I help you with something?
Same Mans Voice: Phoebe, come on!

Chandler: Hey.
Ross:  You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Rachel: Oh! I knew it! What happened?

Ross: Umm, she kissed me.
Rachel: What?! You kissed!
Chandler:  Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Monica:  Shhhh!!!

Rachel: Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
Monica: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Wow!
Joey:  What is the matter with you?!

Phoebe: No! Barry and Mindy.
Joey: Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross.  Who-whos Barry and Mindy?
Rachel: Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.

Joey: Ohh-oh, wasnt he cheating on you with her?
Rachel: Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Monica: Why did they get divorced?

Rachel: Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isnt that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
Ross: I know what you mean, Ive always wondered how different my life would be if-if Id never gotten divorced.
Phoebe: Which time?

Ross: Id bet Id still be doing my kara-tay.  Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from yknow, not doing anything else physical.
Chandler: Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
Monica: And what if I was still fat?  Well, you wouldnt be dating me, thats for sure.

Chandler: What, you guys really think that Im that shallow?
Ross: No, I just think Monica was that fat.
Joey: Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives!  Oh-hey, theres Carol again!

Chandler: What if I had had the guts to quit my job? Id probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my jobs fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I dont have to wear a tie.
Phoebe: What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
Ross: What?!
Rachel: Merrill Lynch?

Joey: So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
Monica: Hes not boring! Hes just-hes just low key.
Monica's Boyfriend:  Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte. 

Monica: Thanks.
Monica's Boyfriend: Yeah. Yknow, the hazelnut actually not a nut, its a seed.
Joey:  Wow!!

Monica's Boyfriend: Can anyone else name a well known seed thats been masquerading as a nut?
Joey: Oh dear God, let me think. 
Chandler:  Hey.

Joey: Hey.
Monica: Oh no! Whats the matter?
Chandler: Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."

Ross: Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
Monica:  Okay! 

Monica: A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Chandler: Well, you couldnt get them anyway. Ian doesnt plan anymore and Derrick  And Derrick is a name I shouldnt know.
Joey:  Hey Mon, do you have another pillow?  Yknow, something a little snugglyer?

Chandler: Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Joey: Well, the duck
Rachel: What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!

Joey: Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
Chandler: Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Monica: Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!

Chandler: Uh-huh!
Joey:  Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, Im gonna get cranky!
Rachel: Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!

Mrs. Geller: So Chandler, youre parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
Chandler: Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
Mr. Geller: I remember when we first got engaged.

Chandler: Oh, I dont think I ever heard that story.
Monica: Oh dad, really you dont need to
Mr. Geller:  Well, Id gotten Judy pregnant. I still dont know that happened.
Mrs. Geller:  You dont know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!

Chandler: What a sweet story.
Monica: Well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
Mr. Geller: What?! They wanted a scary story!

Monica: You bought the beach house when I was 23!
Mr. Geller: Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you cant put a price on that sweetie.
Mrs. Geller: We really do feel bad about this though.

Mr. Geller: We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
Monica: What about when I started dating Chandler?
Mrs. Geller: Well it was Chandler! We didnt think hed ever propose!
Chandler: Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. 

Monica: I cant believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
Mrs. Geller: We might still have some money, if your father didnt think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
Mr. Geller: It seemed like such a simple idea.

Monica: I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
Chandler: I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. Shes saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to  Dollywood.
Rachel: Well what happened at dinner?

Monica: My parents spent the money for our wedding!
Phoebe:  My God! What did you order?!
Rachel: Wait, but theres no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
Chandler: Honey, its gonna be okay.

Monica: No! No its not! Its not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
Rachel: No, yknow what? Its gonna be okay. I mean you dont have to have this rustic Italian feast. Yknow? And-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. 
Chandler: Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that were gonna get married.

Rachel: Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
Phoebe: Look, why dont you just pay for it yourself?
Monica: How? I dont have any money.
Chandler: Well, I have some.

Monica:  How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
Rachel:  Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
Chandler: Well, youre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Rachel and Monica: Ah, yeah!

Chandler: Well, come on, Ive been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
Phoebe:  Wow!  Hello, Mr. Chandler.
Monica: This is the most special day of our lives.

Joey: Oh, yknow what? Its probably just your burnin loins.
Ross:  Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Rachel: Nothing!

Chandler: So, what do you think?
Ross: About what?
Rachel: Yeah, what?
Joey: What?

Chandler: No I didnt!
Ross: Are you sure?
Rachel: Yeah-yeah, did-didnt you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm
Joey: Feminine.

Rachel: Yes!
Chandler: No!
Monica: Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.

Phoebe: So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
Chandler: Thats okay Pheebs, were not having a party or anything, so you dont have to get us
Monica:  If someone wants to give us a present, we dont want to deprive them of that joy.
Rachel: Oh, yknow what you should get em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.

Monica: Oh, I already have one. 
Phoebe: Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
Rachel: Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.

Monica: Uh-huh, yeah.
Phoebe: You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
Chandler: Dying people say the craziest things.

Monica: Okay. Im gonna be the mom that makes the worlds best chocolate chip cookies.
Chandler: Our kids are gonna be fat arent they.
Joey:  Ahoy!

Chandler: Hey! Hows the boat?!
Joey: Great! Im finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Monica: Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?

Joey: Oh, its great! Its a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. 
Chandler: Well, its good that you finally have a place to do that.
Rachel: Yknow Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.

Joey: You could?
Rachel: Yeah! Ive been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
Phoebe: Your own boat?

Chandler: Then free as a bird. Whats up?
Ross: My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
Monica: Wow! Thats great! Dad must really like you, he doesnt ask just anyone to play.

Ross: Yeah.
Monica: He hates to lose.
Chandler: Oh no problem, maybe Ill play with my left hand.

Ross: Youre not a lefty? 
Chandler: Does anybody know me?!
Monica: Whats wrong Phoebe?
Phoebe: I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!

Monica: No!! Why didnt you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
Phoebe:  Because Im normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
Ross: Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
Chandler: Dont worry about it Pheebs.

Ross: No one got me an engagement present.
Phoebe: Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.  
Chandler: An old cookie?
Monica:  This is what happens when you dont register for gifts!

Phoebe: Why not?
Chandler: Cause its gross.
Monica: No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.

Monica: You dont?  Well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman.
Phoebe: That and arrogance.
Joey:  Hey.

Monica: Hey! How was sailing?
Joey: I dont want to talk about it. Yknow, you couldve at least saved me a whole cookie. 
Monica and Phoebe: No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!

Joey:  Women are mean!!! 
Phoebe: I cant believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmothers legacy is this crumb.  I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Ross:  Hey.
Monica: Hey! How was it?

Monica: You gave my father a lap dance!
Chandler: Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Ross: Cause otherwise theyd have to call it the room room.

Chandler: Not that big a deal? Therethere was touching of things.
Ross: Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
Monica: Listen, Im sure that dad doesnt care. He probably thought this was funny; hell be telling this story for years!

Chandler: I dont want him to tell this story for years.
Ross: Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
Monica: I wasnt escaping.

Chandler:  All right, Im off to see your dad.
Ross: Whoa-whoa, arent you a little over dressed?
Rachel:  Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.

Chandler: Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to faceAnd by face I dont mean his lap. And by face, I dont mean my ass. 
Ross:  Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
Rachel: I dont know. Yknow, they didnt get us anything.

Ross: Hey.
Rachel: Well hello! So, when are we gettin back out on the water matey? 
Joey: Oh uh, I dont know the boat way to say this, but uh never!

Rachel: What? I was just trying to teach you.
Joey: Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Ross: Yeeeeeep Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dads boat she wouldnt let me help at all.

Monica: No, just a Friday night.
Ross: Ohh, these are pretty good.
Phoebe: Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.

Phoebe: Oh yeahNo, she was really nice to me, but shes in hell for sure.
Monica: Well, Ive tried everything. I give up. I guess Im not gonna be the mom who makes the worlds best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right.
Ross: Aww, Pheeb, come on isnt there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?

Mac: Well, I couldnt have done it without you buddy. Youre a genius.
C.H.E.E.S.E: Oh yeah? Well then how come I cant get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?
Joey:  So, what did you guys think?
Monica:  Hello?  Hold on please. Joey, its your mom. 
Chandler: Its your mommy. Its your mommy.
Ross: Ohhhh
Rachel: Thats nice.

Joey:  Mom, so what did you think? 
Rachel: Well that was ummOkay.
Ross: It wasnt the best.
Chandler: That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
Monica: Wh-what are we gonna tell him?

Ross: Well, the lighting was okay.
Rachel: Ohh no you dont! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
Monica: And I have costumes.

Ross: Oh great! That means Im stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there  and you were sittin right here! Whoa!"
Rachel: What are you gonna do Pheebs?
Phoebe: I dont know. I dont know. I cant lie to him again. Oh no Ino! Im just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Chandler: And say nothing?

Monica: Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
Phoebe: What? You mean behind my back?
Rachel:  Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! Youll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and
Joey:  You guys! You guys! Youre not gonna believe what my agent just told me!

Rachel: Okay, so anyway Im sittin in my office and guess who walks in.
Joey: Im gonna be on two TV shows!
Monica and Phoebe: Oh, thats great!!

Rachel: Yeah. Sure. 

Chandler: Can you people not see me?!

Ross: Wh-whats up?
Whitney: Well, I went over to Kyles last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing

Joey: Yeah, we look great together.

Monica: Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
Joey: Yknow, we dont have to imagine.
Chandler: Im marrying her.

Monica: Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Rachel: Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope its you!
Phoebe: I hope its you.

Rachel: Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
Monica: Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine
Phoebe: Yes!!! Oh!!

Rachel: Hypothetically!
Phoebe: Still.
Monica: If Phoebe were my maid of honor

Rachel: Yeah thats actually a pretty good idea.

Rachel:  You have been maid of honor before?!!
Phoebe: See? This is exactly why you shouldnt lie!

Rachel: How come you are?!
Phoebe: Because I cared enough to lie!
Joey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how youd handle maid of honor type situations.

Phoebe: Hey there, you handsome thing. 
Ross: Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio. 
Joey: Hi.

Joey:  Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!

Umm, umm, okay, uh I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Ross and Joey: Oh! Thats nice.

Rachel: Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, Ive known them separately and Ive known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass  to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Joey: Wow.  Good speech.
Ross: Yeah, it really was!

Rachel: Aw, thanks!
Ross: Okay Phoebe, I guess youre next  although I really dont see the point.
Joey: Yeah.
Phoebe: Okay, I cant believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.

Phoebe and Rachel: Oh no, yeah.
Rachel: Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, shes not lookin for a serious relationship.

Joey: No hey Rach, its cool okay? Yknow Im a loner too!  Right?
Phoebe: Hey Joey, yknow what? You are way to good for her.
Rachel: Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell em youre not looking for a relationship.

Monica: What are we gonna do?
Chandler: I say we go with Careless Whisper.
Janice: Chandler?

Chandler:  Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Monica: Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Janice: Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldnt really be alone tonight.  I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.

Monica:  Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice arent they?
Janice: Please, its because otherwise I really dont know what I might do.
Chandler: Arent you just a tinsy bit curious?

Janice: Okay! 
Monica: Well justwell just let her stay.
Chandler: No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!

Monica: I never stop thinking about it.
Janice: Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
Chandler: Janice, Im sorry but umm, you cant stay here tonight.

Janice: He does?
Chandler: Say again?
Monica: Thats right. Thats right. And that is why you cant stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldnt come to the wedding.

Ross:  Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving! 
Chandler: No, no, no. No-no-no. 
Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe: Shhhh! 

Ross: What? That's like insanely easy! 
Chandler: Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen . 
Monica: It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose. 

Ross: What? You forgot fourteen states? 
Monica: Nobody cares about the Dakotas. 
Chandler: Oh, okay, time's up! 
Rachel: All right, I got 48. 

Chandler: Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead invegetables, Joey? 
Joey: Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game. 
Ross: Wow, how many have you got? 

Joey: Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team! 
Chandler: Does South Oregon have a sports-team?  There you go. 
Rachel:  How come we have one extra place setting? 
Monica: 'Cause you invited your assistant. 

Rachel: Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things. 
Monica: Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake,  but I still do.
Phoebe: Regular Celery!  Oh, I already have that.  
Ross: Done! With time a-to-spare. 
Chandler: Oooh that may be a New World's record  

Ross: What? That's impossible. 
Joey: 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states? 
Monica: All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food! 
Chandler: I am only one man!  Okay Ross, time is up! 

Ross: You're on! 
Joey:  All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have. 
Monica:  Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work? 

Joey: But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right? 
Monica: Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay? 
Ross: Pshhshhh!

Monica: Chandler? Can you give me a hand?  
Chandler: Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment. 
Joey: Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States. 
Phoebe: Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk. 
Ross: Phoebe, why is your bag moving? 

Phoebe: Oh, it's not! 
Rachel: Seriously, it's moving! 
Joey: What the hell is in there? 

Phoebe: I'm sorry, who's this? 
Monica: Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch! 
Chandler: Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue! 

Phoebe:  They're here already? How are they doing this? 
Rachel:  Hi Tag! What are you doing here? 
Tag: I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good. 

Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry. 
Tag: Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
Ross: Ohio!! Thank you! 
Chandler: Huh! Where is the dog?!

Ross: What dog? There-there's no dog here. 
Joey: Yeah that dog left! 
Monica:  Phoebe! Phoebe, open up! 
Phoebe: There's no dog in here. 
Chandler: Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking! 

Phoebe: Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait.  Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
Monica: Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic! 
Chandler: Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up! 

Phoebe: That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days 
Chandler:  Really? 
Monica: Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog? 

Chandler: Okay, it's um
Joey:  Don't do it! 
Monica: Don't do what? 

Chandler:  I have to! Okay? It's time!  Okay, I hate dogs. 
All: What? 
Phoebe: Are you crazy? 
Ross: Are you out of your mind?

Phoebe: Why? 
Joey: Told ya. 
Chandler: They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit. 
Ross: Right, they are scary.  Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
Rachel: Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies? 

Chandler:  Okay, you are new!
Joey: Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin ice cream. 
Phoebe: You don't like ice cream? 
Ross: It's too cold. 

Chandler: And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go.  Oh my god!!
Ross: How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s. 
Monica: 1250.

Ross: Damn, I forgot you were here. 
Phoebe: All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Rosss. We'll be back in a minute. 
Rachel: Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question? 
Monica: Yeah. 

Rachel: When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move? 
Phoebe: Oh, I'd say about a month. 
Monica: Really? I'd say 3 to 4. 
Joey: Half hour. 

Rachel: Interesting. 
Monica: When it's your assistant, I would say never. 
Joey: All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point. 

Rachel: Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!  
Joey:  All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it! 
Tag: What? 

Phoebe: Wash your hands!!!
Chandler: How did youknow?  
Ross: Hey! What's she doing back here? 
Monica: Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream! 

Ross: Yeah, but, but look what I'm... 
Phoebe: See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.  
Chandler:  Where's Monica? 

Ross: Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friendPhyllistake away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed. 
Joey:  Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food!  What's the matter? 
Chandler: Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away. 

Joey: If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah. 
Phoebe:  Hey, is Chandler here? 
Chandler: No, no he went for a walk. 

Phoebe: Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back! 
Rachel:  Hi! 
Joey: Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here! 

Phoebe: Oh no, the dog's not going to be there! 
Joey: You think? 
Monica: Hi, honey. 
Chandler: Please, please, please, don't be mad at me. 

Monica: What? Why, why would... 
Phoebe:  Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't. 
Chandler: Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Yknow, for you, and I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.  

Phoebe: We have good news, look whose back! 
Rachel:  Hi! 
Chandler: Clunkers?! Oh my god! 
Monica: That's right, she came back all by herself. 

Phoebe: Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped? 
Ross: Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something. 
Chandler: It's up to you. 
Rachel: Oh, hi! How are you doing? 
Tag: I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots. 

Rachel: Oh. 
Tag: Thanks for having me over, you guys. 
Ross: Tag? Y-You're going?  Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again? 

Tag: Colorado. 
Ross: Ah, what good are you.  
Rachel: Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace. 

Ben:  Thanks daddy.
Ross: No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, its all yours. 
Chandler: Okay. Okay.

Ross: Yes! Yes! Yes!! 
Phoebe: His first big kids bike, this is so exciting!
Monica: Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, andit bent.

Ross:  What?!
Phoebe: Well, we didnt have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
Chandler: That sounds like my first bike.  My dad gave me his old one.

Ross: Ohh.
Monica: Did the girl ever let you ride it?
Phoebe: No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front.  So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.

Chandler: Hey! What are you guys doing? 
Joey: Hey.
Monica: Making holiday candy for the neighbors.

Chandler: But we dont know the neighbors.
Joey: I do. Theres uh, lets see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids Ive Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
Monica: See? This is exactly why Im making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.

Chandler: Eh, somebodys in a good mood!
Rachel: Well, why shouldnt I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Monica: Where you can make out with your assistant.

Monica: Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Joey: Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
Phoebe: Yeah, and theyve been coming by all day. They love it!

Monica: Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
Ross: Mine stole my newspaper! Its like a crime wave!!  Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Phoebe: Sure!

Monica:  Who is that?!
Chandler: Dont worry, Im brave! I am brave! II am brave!  No-no-no-no!!   Can you tell me who is there please?
The Knocker: My name is Gary, I live upstairs.
Gary: Hi!

Monica: Oh please!  Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
Chandler:  4:00 A.M.
Gary: So, can I get some candy?

Chandler: I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work!   He does not know that I am not some of us.
Monica: Umm, listen I am sorry, but Ill put some out first thing in the morning.
Gary: Well okay, Ill swing by later. Do you live in this building? 

Monica: Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Joey: Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Chandler: Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!

Joey:  Those two only had each other!
Ross: Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Monica: Oh yeah! I saw her walkin it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.

Joey: Hey Pheebs?
Phoebe: Oh hi!
Chandler: Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?

Monica: See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs.  Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
Chandler:  What happened? Im just eating candy.
Rachel: Maybe its not as bad as I think. Yknow, maybe they didnt take it the way I meant it.

Chandler: Absolutely! Yknow, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
Rachel: Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Joey: Hey Rach?

Rachel: Ugh!
Joey: Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
The Woman: Hi! Im sorry, I know its after hours but I really need candy.
Monica: Im sorry, I cant help you. See?  Rules are rules.

The Woman: Please, cant you help me out?
Joey:  Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Chandler: Maybe, isnt she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
Monica:  All right, Ill do it just this once! But you cant tell anybody!

The Woman:  Thank you.
Monica:  Its unbelievable! I-I cant believe that sign didnt work!
Chandler: Yknow what would work?

Rachel: Oh no-no-no
Tag:  Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.
Mr. Zelner: You wrote that you have a cute touchie?

Tag:  Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and Im kinda strangely proud of my butt.
Mr. Zelner: Its kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I cant figure out what this is?
Rachel: Youre lookin at it upside downyknow what?  It doesnt matter.

Mr. Zelner: Yeah, its not like I dont have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But theres a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now?  No? Okay, well uh, youve  got my fax number. 
Rachel: Whoa! I cant believe you did that. That was really sweet.
Tag: No, dont worry about it.

Chandler:  What is going on? 
The Man: Were waiting for the candy.  Bring out the candy!
Joey: Yeah lady! Give us candy!!

Chandler: Get in here!  Hey, and you can not smoke in here!   Merry Christmas.
Monica:  Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
All: We want candy! We want candy now! 

Chandler: All right, yknow what? Forget it, all of you forget it! Youve ruined it! Go home! Youve ruined it! Youve ruined it!
Joey: Thats right, its all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!  
Monica:  Thank you.

Chandler: Hey!
Rachel and Monica: Hi!
Phoebe: Haaaa...  ... ahhhh!

Chandler: Skull?
Phoebe: Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
Rachel:  Oh my god!!

Phoebe: No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it. 
Ross:  Hey!
All: Hey!
Monica:  Licorice?

Ross:  Sure!  Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
All: Ohh! That's great!
Monica: Are you gonna dress up as Santa?

Ross: Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
Phoebe: And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
Rachel: You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.

Ross: Hmm.
Joey: Hey. 
Rachel:  Did you know he was in there?
Monica: No.
Chandler: How long have we been home?

Chandler: Why not?
Monica: Bing's weird.
Phoebe:  Oh, hey, you guys!

Chandler: Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.

Monica: Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
Phoebe: Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
Chandler: Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?

Phoebe: Really? So she said, she didnt wanna live with me anymore?
Chandler: No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
Monica: Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.

Chandler:  Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please? 
Monica: I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Maitre d': Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.

Monica:  Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
Chandler:  Excuse me...
Male Guest:  Good evening. 

Rachel:  Ha!
Phoebe: So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Yknow, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
Joey: Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four...
Rachel and Joey: Tequila!!

Gunther: Here you go.
Chandler: Thank you Gunther, put it there.  Definitely not easier with coins.  Thank you.
Joey: Thank you.   Hey Pheebs!
Phoebe: Hey!

Joey: Here.  Now I only owe you $49.50.
Chandler: Hey Pheebs!
Phoebe: Hey! 

Chandler: If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
Monica: It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
Phoebe: Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.

Rachel: Joey, yknow that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
Joey: What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
Phoebe:  Hey, Joey, I got you another present. 

Joey: Oh wait, before you tell me what it is!  Okay, what is it?
Phoebe: It's atarantula!  Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
Rachel: What are you talking about? I love them!  Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?

Joey: Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! 
Rachel: Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
Phoebe:  Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here. 

Ross:  Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Monica: Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way fromTexas.
Ben: Texas?

Ross: Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Chandler:  Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Ben: Santa! 

Chandler: You bet I did, Ben, put it there!   Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small!  Ho, ho, ho!
Monica: Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
Ross:  What are you doing?

Chandler: Then it's okay! 
Ross: Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
Ben: No! Why does he have to go?

Chandler: Because, if Santa and the HolidayArmadillo?  ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
Ben: No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
Ross: Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.

Ross: The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, its time to light the Hanukkah candles! 
Rachel:  Hey! 
Phoebe: Oh.

Joey: Ill see you at 8:00.
Phoebe: Okay.  
Chandler: Oh, whats at 8:00?

Phoebe: Duly noted.
Ross: Thanks.   Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Monica: What are you talking about?

Ross: No.
Monica: My God, I cant believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
Chandler: Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannies made some new friends.

Phoebe: Oh thats a nickname we were trying out.
Ross: Hey, yknow what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron! 
Joey:  Hey!

Phoebe: So what?! That doesnt give you the right to ditch me!
Joey: Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
Ross: Phoebe hes right, that is the rule.

Joey: Hey.
Monica: Hey.
Ross: So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasnt a mistake. Ahh, theres-theres limited seating in the hall.

Monica: Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasnt invited and you got "and guest?!"
Joey: Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Rosss behalf. I-I think the rule applies here yknow, since she has a chance to get on broad back
Ross:  Not broad backed!

Monica: Because! Shes my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! Were family yknow? Well thats important to me.
Ross: Okay, all right, Ill take you. Ill go call Joan. 
Joey: Aww thats nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.

Rachel: Oh its umm, its tofu cake. Do you want some? 
Chandler: What are you doing tonight?
Joey: Huh? Uh

Monica: Limited seating my ass. Lets see who made the cut.  Hi!
The Wedding Guest: Hi!

The Waiter: Its uh, its already been roasted.
Joey: Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Phoebe: Oh Joey, weve heard the specials three times! Okay? Theres prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli. 

The Waiter: Actually were out of the lobster ravioli. 
Joey: Oh well, that changes everything!  Yknow what Pheebs?
Phoebe: Huh?

The Woman: Ross, sweetheart!
Ross: Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
Aunt Millie: Isnt it a beautiful wedding?!

Ross: That bitch! 
Frannie:  Monica! What

Ross:  Hi Frannie, congratulations.
Monica: You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! WhatWhy wouldnt you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?!  Stuart!
Frannie: I believe you know my husband.

David: Bye Phoebe. 
Phoebe:  Okay, nows not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.

All: Okay! Okay! 
Phoebe:  There it is! Oh, look at that! Isnt Mother Nature amazing?
Chandler:  Thats a plane!

Phoebe: Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, thats pretty amazing too.
Tag: Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.
Rachel: No. No, you cant.

Tag: What?
Rachel: Oh I dont-I dont know.
Ross: Man, look at all those stars!  Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesnt it?
Joey:  Yknow what else makes you wonder?

Monica: Okay, weve been out here for two hours and we havent seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandlers getting chilly. 
Chandler:  No, Im not!
Joey: Then why are you wearing Monicas jacket?

Chandler: Because its flattering!  Come on Monica! Come on Monica! 
Rachel: Yeah actually, I think were gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
Phoebe: Oh! I wont say, no to a movie!

Rachel: Oh. 
Joey:  Ross!
Ross: What?

Ross: Oh, it looks like mom and dads house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic isOh my God!!

Monica: I cant believe mom and dad are selling the house!

Ross: Hey.
Monica: Hey!
Phoebe: Ugh, I hate this year!

Ross: Whats wrong with this year?
Phoebe: Well okay, its already February and Ive only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
Monica: That was me and Ross.

Phoebe: Oh thats right!
Ross: Hey, yknow if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
Monica: Oh thats a great idea. Youre really good on the phone.

Ross:  Lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
Mr. Geller: Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.
Monica: Oh, thats okay, I cant wait to see everything again! All of the memories

Mr. Geller: Well, I dont know whats in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.
Monica: I used to love to play restaurant.
Ross: Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.

Monica: Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies! 
Mr. Geller: So, I think youre boxes are over here. 
Ross: Wow! Great!  Wait, dad who-whos cigarettes are these?

Chandler: My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita! 
Rachel: You will like it!
Joey: No I wont.

Monica: Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
Mr. Geller:  Thats a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
Ross:  Yeah! Yeah!  Oh, this will make a great memory.

Monica: What?
Ross: Dad?
Mr. Geller: Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. Im sorry.

Rachel: What? Wh-hey!
Joey: Well, it looks like it wasnt heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now! 
Chandler: Joey you broke my chair!!

Joey:  Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. Im so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
Rachel: Uh-huh! Nice try, but you dont get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap!  No I take that back!
Chandler: I think I should get the chair!

Joey: How do you figure?
Chandler: Because you  broke a chair and you  broke a chair! The only one around here that hasnt broke a chair, is me!
Rachel: No-no-no! This chairs not going anywhere.

Phoebe:  Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? Hes the supply manager around here.
Marge: Sorry, I dont know any Earl.
Earl:  Im right here!!!!

Monica: Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this.  It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I dont even know what it is! Ohh, its still soft.  What do you think this is?
Ross: All right. I think it was a mouse.
Mr. Geller:  How are you honey?

Monica:  What?!
Ross:  What?!!!
Mr. Geller: Ive been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mothers right, I do look like an ass.

Monica: Wait, youre giving me your Porsche, youre kidding me right?!
Ross: Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
Mr. Geller:  Why dont we take it for a spin?

Joey: Ahhh  Eh?
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Monica:  Hey guys!

Rachel: Hey!
Joey: Hey!

Chandler:  Shes not as pretty as she was when she was 29.

Tag: Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you dont use the words old or downhill or  they still look pretty damn good. 
Joey: They do!
Phoebe: Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
Monica: Chocolate-chip pancakes!
Ross: Weve got presents!
Rachel: Good ones?

Monica: They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
Rachel: Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
Joey: Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
Ross: Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?

Joey:  Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!! 
Rachel: Yknow, Im still 29 in Guam.
Ross: Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?

Monica: Rach, youre in a great place in your life. Come on, youve got a great job! Good friends
Joey: Yeah, youre roommate is a soap opera star.
Rachel: Look, yknow I know my lifes going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people whove accomplished so many other goals by the time theyre thirty.
Phoebe: Yeah, but you shouldnt compare yourself to me.
Flashback to: The Street in front of Central Perk, Ross and Joey are holding a yellow tape across the road and everyone is cheering Phoebe as she bounces around the corner on a hippity-hop.
All: Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!

Rachel: Nothing. I dont want to do anything.
Monica: Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
Ross: Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
Flashback to: A street, Ross is sitting in his newly purchased MGB. Which is one of the better British sports cars ever made. Of course, better is a relative term. Which reminds me of a joke. Why dont the British make computers? Because they couldnt figure out how to make them leak oil. Anyway, the gang is all staring at his new purchase.

Ross:  I dont know, but-but look how shiny!
Monica: I cant believe you bought this.
Rachel: Really! God Ross, what were you thinking?  I know its really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
Phoebe: Oh, well get in line missy.  So, can I have a ride stud?

Rachel:  Get out, get out of my apartment. 
Monica: All right Rach, for what its worth, I think that youre doing great. I mean yknow lets face it, no one handles this well.
Phoebe: Least of all you.
Tag: Why? What youd do?

Monica: Werent you asked to leave sonny?
Chandler:  Would you put that back on?! Monicas gonna be here any minute!
Joey: But it hurts my Joeys Apple.

Ross: Okay, forward. ForwardStop!  Okay, backStop!  Okay, forwardStop! Stop! Stop!
Monica: Ross, just forget about it. This guys got you totally wedged in.
Woman:  Is this yours?
Joey: Well actually

Chandler: See?  Here we go. 
Mr. Geller: Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug! 
Mrs. Geller:  Dont get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow.
Monica:  Paul!

Chandler: Monicas a little drunk.
Phoebe: Yay! I love drunk Monica!
Monica: Awwwww 

Chandler:  Go change!  She doesnt want her parents to know shes drunk.
Phoebe: Ohh! All right! All right. Heres what well do, Ill get twice as drunk as Monica and then no ones will even notice her.
Rachel: Whats-whats going on? Phils really pissed!

Tag: It wasnt on your list, but hopefully youll think its really fun.
Rachel:  A scooter! 
Ross:  Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.

Rachel: Okay.
Joey: Now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you guys?
Chandler: For my last birthday you gave me a hug!  Okay, read the card! Read the card!

Ross: What? 
Rachel: Okay! Yknow what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids
Phoebe: Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.

Rachel:  Im telling you its like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
Ross:  Youre drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe Im a little drunk.
Chandler:  Oh thats great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please?  There we go.
Joey:  Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?

Chandler:  How are you feeling?
Monica: You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now! 
Ross: I really wish that you wouldnt.

Chandler: Pheebs!!
Phoebe: Dont you see? Everyones looking at me! The plans working! I didnt even have to take off my top yet!
Mrs. Geller: Speech! Come on Monica!
Ross: Come on!
All: Come on! Speech!
Mr. Geller:  Hey Chandler, you cant keep your hands off her for one second!

Mrs. Geller: Oh-ho, I think its nice.
Chandler: I think its necessary. 
Monica: I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends
Phoebe:  Wooo!! Hoo!!

Phoebe: No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? Ill see you guys later. Thanks. 
Rachel: Hey.  Oh, poor Pheebs.
Joey: Hey, yknow what you guys? I think Im gonna go walk her home.  
Monica: Oh man!
Chandler: What?

Monica: Hes gonna eat the cake!
Joey: Pheebs! Wait up!  Listen uh, close your eyes.  Maybe thats one thing you can cross off your list.
Phoebe: Oh yeah.

Rachel: Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
Phoebe: You did the right thing.
Joey:  I dont like this anymore. 
Chandler: Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
Ross: God, do you realize in ten years were gonna be 40?

Monica: Im glad youre here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.
Rachel:  Ohh
Ross: Whats the matter? You okay?

Rachel: Yeah, its just yknow
Chandler:  Monica said wedding.
Monica: Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.

Rachel: Ohhh
Ross: Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
Chandler: Too?

Ross: Sorry, Im kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
Chandler: Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. 
Joey:  Hey!
All: Hey!

Joey: Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, youre not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
All: Oh!!
Chandler: Thats great!

Joey: And-and-and not only that, Im gettin a new brain!!
Chandler: So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
Rachel: Wait, what do you mean youre getting a new brain?

Joey: Well, I think its ridiculous that you havent had sex in three and a half months.
Ross:  Its winter, they are fewer people on the street. 
Monica: Who are they killing off?

Joey: Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
Rachel and Monica: Noo!!
Monica: Shes my favorite character on DOOL.

Joey: Nice.
Rachel: She is so good at throwing drinks in peoples faces, I mean I dont think Ive ever seen her finish a beverage.
Monica: And the way she slaps all the time!

Rachel: Oh!
Monica: Wouldnt you love to do it just once?! 
Chandler: Dont do it.

Rachel: Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Joey: Oh, tell me about it. And shes been on the show forever, its gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Ross: Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?

Cecilia: Oh, just years of experience.
Dina:  Can I get some ice here?!
Joey: Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.

Joey: Joey.
Cecilia: Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me. 
The Writer: It wasnt my decision!

Chandler: Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland byVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. 
Ross: Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
Monica: No! No-no theyre not. Theyre still very angry! But yknow Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.

Rachel: Hey! Hey!
Phoebe and Rachel:  Who is it?
Guy: Hi! Its Tom, Im here to pick up the phone.

Megan: Oh, youre so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass. 
Phoebe: Ooh, is that spelled with a C or a K? Oh my God! It doesnt matter; theyre both great!
Rachel: Oh yknow what? Yknow what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinmans and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
The Woman: I own this store.

A Woman: What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!
Rachel:  So this is Brooklyn.
Monica: All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what youre looking for!  Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right?  Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.

Monica: Phoebe, hes gotta be in the room for that to work.

Chandler:  What are you guys talking about?
Monica: Well umm, we were just talking about the yknow, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether yknow, they were the right way to go.
Rachel: Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now Im not saying that theres any connection here yknow, but they did tell me thats why they got divorced.

Ross: Oh yeah its fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
Joey:  Kristen?
Kristen: Joey!

Joey: Hi!
Ross: Hi.  Its nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I dont anymore.
Kristen: Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.

Ross: Yes. And another time after that. Boy Im getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
Kristen: You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
Joey:  Yeah. So uh Ross, well nowwhy did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?

Kristen: Do you two know each other?
Joey and Ross: No. No.
Joey: No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Ross: Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?

Joey: Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
Monica: Joey!

Monica:  Okay, Ill go!

Phoebe: Im just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and cant perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
The Cute Guy:  Hi!
Monica: Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, Im engaged. 

Ross: Theres this kid in my class who said hes in love with me.
Joey: Whoa!
Rachel:  Whoa what?

Joey: Ross has a boyfriend.
Ross: I do-I do not have a boyfriend. Theres a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
Rachel: Really?

Ross: Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
Rachel: Yeah.
Joey: Howd you get over that teacher?

Jake: All right. Bye. 
Phoebe: Bye!  We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.

Ross: Let me see that!  Oh man!
Chandler: The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. 
Joey:  Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Monica: All right thats it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I dont care!

Monica: Thank you.
Phoebe: Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. 

Monica: Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts. 
Phoebe: Oh! Yeah!

Chandler: Yeah, Im not sure I can do that.

Ross: ...everyone, this is Chandler!
Fat Monica: Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Chandler:  Okay.
Rachel: Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."

Monica: Its kind of an important one!
Chandler: Oh, yknow-yknow what, I was looking at it upside down.
Rachel: Well, yknow, sometimes that helps.

Ross:  Im getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!

Chandler: Okay!  Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God, I thought  Wait a minute, I-I can do this.  I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you,  you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.  And if youll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.  Monica, will you marry me?

Ross: Phoebe thats not true.
Phoebe: Yeah, youre right. Hows the Mrs.?
Rachel: I cant believe theyve been together for three years.
Joey:  Has it been that long?!

Joey: Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
Chandler: I've had a very long, hard day.

Joey: Okay.
Chandler: Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.

Chandler: No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Monica: Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.

Joey: All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
Monica:  I can't wait to be with you!  I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.

Monica: She's bluffing!

Chandler: Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! 
Phoebe: He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Joey:  Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
Rachel: Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.

Joey: It's not my first time.

Rachel: Wow! I cant believe you lied to me.

Monica: Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?!
Chandler: Well he doesnt have to know! Its not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Phoebe: Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.

Rachel: Oh.
Transcribers Note: She puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. Does anyone know why that is? Its a tradition left over from Porsches racing history. The worlds greatest endurance race is the 24 Hours of LeMans. Which is in France and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on Saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on Sunday.  In the 60s LeMans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. At the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. Porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. Since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. The drivers left hand did nothing. Porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. Thats why every Porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.
Ross: No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car!  Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! 

Man: Hey guys!
Joey: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey sweetie!

Man:  Wait a minute!
Phoebe: What?  Oh.  Ooh.  Whoa! That one kept going. 
Joey: So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?

Man:  Its Jake.
Joey: Joey.  Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
Jake: Yeah, big fan.

And in stead, I found everything that Id ever been looking for my whole life. And nowhere we arewith our future before usand I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you dont want to. You go!
Joey: Chandler?
Chandler:  No, thats okay.  Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way its okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if Im sure? 

Joey: You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
Chandler: I do.
Monica: I do.

Joey: We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife.  Now kiss her again.

Ross: Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way  which uh, which was misleading. Well Im  Hello.
Joey: Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I wouldve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and thats just for ugly people.
Chandler: What size shoes do you wear?

Joey: Okay fine! Im a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, Ill show ya!
Monica: Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!

Rachel: Uh-hmm. Im just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
Waiter: Champagne?

Phoebe:  What?!  Why bother?
Monica: How do you feel?
Rachel: I dont know. I dont know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I dont want to make.  Somebody just take this away from me!!

Phoebe: When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.
Monica: Yes! Maybe its a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?
Rachel: How many ways are there to do that?

Dr. Green: Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!
Mona: Tramp?!

Chandler: Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it.  Maam, are you also a stripper?
Hooker: Uh, no. But I could pretend to strip, but thats gonna cost extra. Okay, heres the extras, handcuffs, spanking 
Joey: Maybe Monicas playing a joke on ya. Yknow? Getting her own husband a hooker, thats pretty funny.

Chandler: That is funny, maybe for my birthday shell murder someone.
Joey: I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
Hooker: Do you mind if I smoke in here?

Mona: How could you have kept all of this from me?
Ross: I was going to tell you, but
Dr. Green: But what?! You figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!

Joey: Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything youre really bad at yknow, sexually?

Ross: Focus.
Rachel: Okay. UmButOkay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.
Mona: How can I be sure on that?

Rachel: Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is. 
Ross: Probably shouldnt touch me.
Mona: Yknow, I-I-I justI dont want to get in the middle of something so complicated.

Rachel: I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single?  I am so gonna leave right now. 
Ross: Should I leave this open for you too?
Mona: Im not sure yet. Why didnt you just tell me about all this?

Dr. Green:  just because youre not in love with the guy you cant
Phoebe:  Wow, you told your dad the truth.
Rachel: About an hour ago.

Joey:  You fall for it every time!

Rachel:  So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?
Will: Yes he was. 
Ross: No. No.

Rachel: So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.
Will: You went out with her?! We had a pact!
Ross: That was in high school! Its not like it was binding forever.

Will: Then why did it have the word eternity in it?
Rachel: Okay Monica, did you know about this?!
Monica: I swear I didnt.  Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?
Ross and Will: Yeah.

Monica: Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.
Ross: Look Rach I-Im sorry, okay? II was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined
Will: Co-founded!

Ross: co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didnt handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
Will: Uh, except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club.
Rachel: Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?

Will: Well, we did a little more than that.
Ross: No-no! No-no. No-no.
Phoebe: What?! What else did you do?

Will: We started a rumor.
Rachel: What rumor?
Phoebe: Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!

Rachel: What?! You heard that?! 
Monica: Everyone at our school heard it!
Chandler: Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!

Rachel: Oh! 
Joey: You are my Everest.
Monica: Joey, you dont have to finish that.

Joey: Oh yes I do. Otherwise whats next? Today Im just a guy who cant finish a turkey, but tomorrow Im the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I justI justI gotta change my pants.  Jeans have no give. 
Rachel:  Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, "Dear Rach, youre such a good person." Not girl! Person!
Ross: Rach, I think youre reading a little too much into it.

Rachel: Yes!
Will: Could you also tell them Im skinny now?
Monica: Oh! Me too!
Ross: Well look-look Im not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!

Rachel: What?
Ross: What?
Monica: Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.

Ross: No.
Rachel: Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
Will: Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he went back to Thailand.
Chandler: Im sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?

Ross: Hey! She didnt look 50!
Chandler: Did she look 16?
Rachel: Ohh, theres a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
Phoebe: Oh!  Wow!

Ross: She didnt photograph well!
Chandler: Well, she probably wasnt familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
Phoebe: So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?

Ross: Only when it was damp!!  I cant believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Yknow what?  Im back in the club!
Will: Yeah! 
Phoebe: I wanna join!
Rachel: WhPhoebe!!

Phoebe: Im sorry. Im sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I didnt go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour.
Rachel: All right, yknowFine! You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie! 
Monica: All right, listen youre just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!

Rachel: Wow
Monica: And Ross, if it werent for Rachels rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!
Ross: As a romancer of the elderly.

Monica: Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-youve been through so much since then. And right now youve got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Cant you just let this go?
Rachel: Shes right.
Ross: Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.
Will: Hold on! You got her pregnant?

Ross: Nope.
Will: So you knocked her up but youre not gonna marry her. Dude!  Anybody?
Phoebe: Okay.  Its exactly how Id imagined it would be.
Joey:  All right wheres that turkey!

Joey: Well thats it. Im done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats. 
Monica: Well Joey, were allwere all very proud of you.
Chandler: Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
Phoebe: Is there anything we can do for you?

Monica: Im sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, "Oh, these are way too expensive for you."
Chandler: She had a point.  
Rachel:  Hi!

Monica: Theyre mine!
Chandler: Yeah well, too bad were gonna have to return them.
Rachel: Return them?! Shh! Theyre gonna hear you!

Joey: No they cant! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
Rachel: Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective!  Right?

Joey: Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Lets hear their plan! Now, whats the future look like for Dina and Bobby?

Bobby: Well its just me and my pal Rooster, the bands name is Numb Nuts.

Rachel:  Really? 
Joey: Dina, if youre having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby!  Dude, thats not a compliment!
Dina: No Joey! I knew you wouldnt be supportive!

Joey: Maybe!  Well! Wellso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb NutsOh forget it! I cant!
Dina: Joey, I am scared to death about this. But I really think I can do it, Im just gonna need some help. And Bobbys gonna be here the whole time.
Bobby: You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, were straight-up gangster rap. 

Dina: Were gonna be all right. I mean, even if were not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.
Joey: Thats right! By his uncle too!
Bobby: And by you.
Rachel: Okay Bobby, why dont we just come over here and let them have a little moment.

Phoebe: No, we hate that.
Monica: That is a slap in the face.

Rachel: You gave her a key to your apartment?!
Ross: Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
Phoebe:  Hey. Ooh Ross! Howd the conversation go?

Ross: No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!  Why didnt I get head of the department? 
Joey: Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm
Rachel: Yeah.

Phoebe: Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning.
Monica: Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game!
Chandler: Who cares? Its a stupid game.

Monica: You only think its stupid because you suck at it.
Chandler: I dont suck. Its sucks. You suck.
Phoebe: Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.

Monica: No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why dont you go home and wait for the thank you card?
Chandler: Why do you want to play this game so bad?
Phoebe: Yeah! Its not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.

Rachel: Right. Wow!
Ross: Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, Im sure I can make it this time. I justI just cant be afraid to get a little bithit by cars. 
Joey: Hey!

Monica: Theyre all Chandler.
Phoebe: Chandler sucks! He couldnt have gotten this good!
Chandler: I did.  But it came at a price.

Monica: Oh my God Phoebe, youre on fire!
Phoebe: I know!
Chandler: One more score to go! You can do it! 

Phoebe: Dont touch me!!
Monica: Dont touch her!!
Chandler: All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!

Monica: How dirty do you think I am? Im telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.
Chandler: Honey, its 2:00 on a Wednesday and Im watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?
Joey:  Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.

Rachel: Hi! Oh, Ross, dont forget, we have that doctors appointment tomorrow!
Ross: Right.
Phoebe: Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?

Ross: With an aptitude for science.
Phoebe: Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?
Rachel: Oh yeah! Ive come up with a bunch of ideas!

Ross: Really? Me too!
Phoebe: Me too!
Rachel: Really?!

Phoebe: Uh huh! If its a girl, Phoebe, and if its a boy, Phoebo!
Ross: Maybe. But it wouldnt hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach, what were you thinking? 
Rachel: Okay! I was thinking if its a girl, how about Sandrine? Its French.

Ross: Well, OK, its for a boy. Well, I know its a little out there, butDarwin.
Rachel: Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
Phoebe: Yeah, by Sandrine.

Ross: Youre just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!
Rachel: Im really, really not.
Phoebe: How-how about you each get five vetoes?

Ross: I dont think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?
Rachel: Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
Dr. Long: Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?

Ross: Uh, no. No, were not.
Rachel: But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether its a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?
Dr. Long: Thats right. But if you dont want to know

Ross: No, no, we want to wait, right?
Rachel: Right. Right.
Dr. Long:  Oh, Ill be right back. And, uh, I know its really not my place, but please dont name your child Phoebo.

Monica: And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!
Chandler: My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
Phoebe:  You guys?

Monica: You just stay here! 
Chandler: Oh, God!

Chandler: Well, lets just say its ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
Rachel: Well, now, wait. Now Im all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.
Monica: No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!

Rachel: Cmon, seriously, you guys, youre not going to make me watch this alone!
Monica: Shes rightof course not. Honey, get the tape.
Chandler:  This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.  Okay, here we go.

Rachel: Okay.  Ooh, my!  Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!
Chandler: Why have I seen this thing three times?!
Monica: Itsstill beautiful.

Rachel: What? Did her ass explode?!
Chandler: No, the babys out! Look, look!
Monica: Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!

Rachel:  Youre going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. Now, youre going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it! 
Woman on TV: I came to the big city to become a star! Ill doanything to make that happen!
Man on TV: Anything?

Rachel: Wow that was a big one.
Chandler: I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me.
Phoebe:  Oh hey you guys!

Chandler: Oh hey!
Rachel: Hi!
Phoebe: Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?

Rachel: Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. Thats why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. Hell find me.
Phoebe: Uh-huh,  and you?
Chandler: No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I dont think they exist.

Phoebe: Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.
Chandler: Come on, dont be crazy.  You dont think theres someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? 
Rachel:  Well, whats he like?!

Phoebe: He has brown hair.
Rachel: Of course, of course.
Chandler: A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!

Phoebe: Yeah? And, hes-hes so centered and mature and confident.
Rachel: Oh, its so sad they never had a chance to meet.
Chandler: Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about.

Phoebe:  Soul mate.
Monica: So, what have you guys been doing?
Don: Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?

Monica: Oh, Id like a latte. Oh yknow what? If youre gonna talk about me, Im gonna go with you. 
Chandler: What are you doing?!
Phoebe: Nothing! I swear to God I didnt know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didnt believe in soul mates. So

Chandler: I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
Phoebe: Theyre just talking, and yknow what? Just because I think theyre soul mates doesnt mean anythings gonna happen.
Monica:  Phoebe, good work.

Don: No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldnt that be incredible?!
Monica: Id move in tomorrow!
Chandler:  Oh come on!  Are you listening to this?
Phoebe: Im so sorry.

Rachel: Yeah.

Monica:  Okay, did you hear that?
Joey: Yeah, a naked bagel game?   Dude, I dont know. Thats a pretty small hole.

Monica: Honey, you gotta talk to her.
Joey: I cant! Yknow? You guys dont know what its like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
Chandler:  I dont know what thats like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"

Phoebe: Oh!  Which can either mean youre having a baby or youre gonna make a scientific discovery!
Rachel: Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
Chandler: What does yours say Pheebs?

Phoebe: Umm Wow, all right.  Wow! Yay! Ooh, Im gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And hes gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night. 
Ross:  Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? Its a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?
Monica: You mean your pink shirt?

Ross: I dont know. I mean I-I guess I could. Its just that we didnt really end things such good terms. And if I go over there Id be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. 
Phoebe:  Oh wait a second you guysfor the last couple weeks Ive been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe hes the tea guy. 
Chandler: Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!  Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?
Rachel: Hi!
Joey: Hey.

Rachel: How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we cant even be in the same room with each other?!
Chandler: Im not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?
Monica: Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?

Chandler: Well, if were gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Yknow alphabetically or by genre?
Monica: Hmm, I dont know. We really have to talk this through.

For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably dont say it enough, but I love you.  When I look around this room, Im-Im saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she cant because shes dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. . Was.  Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember shes dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow!

Rachel: Oh comeOf course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who wouldshe wouldnt be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Yknow what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, Im just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.
Woman: Its actually a bassinet. 

Joey:  That noise can only me one thing.
Chandler:  Hungry monkey.
Ross:  Hungry monkey!  Haaa!  Id like a Wicked Wango card!

Joey: Okay, its an audio question, name this television theme song.

Ross:  Hey!
Phoebe: Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?

Man: Hey Joey, hi! Im Ray; Im the producer of the show.
Joey:  Its a pleasure to meet you Ray.
Ray: And this is Duncan  and Erin, theyre gonna help us out with the audition. So uh, lets get the camera rolling.

Mrs. Green: Well Rachel needs help with the baby.
Rachel: I do. I really do. I dont know anything.
Ross: Im-Im sure thats not true.

Rachel: Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
Phoebe: No, not a thing.
Monica: Its frightening.
Ross: Well uh, yknow what? Even if she doesnt know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didnt live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.
Mrs. Green: Thats true. You do have another child.

Ross: Im telling you.
Rachel: Thank you. 
Mrs. Green: All right you two, Im gonna get going.

Ross: Oh. 
Mrs. Green: Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. Ill let myself out. Its like Im not here, which I almost wasnt.
Monica:  Youre still so funny. Youre so funny.  What do I do?
Phoebe: Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and shes been nothing but terrible to you. And dont forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasnt even thanked you for it.

Ross: No, Monicas restaurant got a horrible review in the Post.  I didnt want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find. 
Joey: Man, this is bad! And Ive had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though.  "Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."
Monica:  Hey!
Chandler: Hey.

Joey: Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
Chandler: Thats what I do now.
Monica: Hey Joey, come taste this.

Cashier: Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?
Rachel: Oh.
Ross: Oh.

Rachel: No-no-no! No, no, no, were not married.
Ross: We are having a baby together, but were not involved.  I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night.  Or, yes stranger, wed like this delivered please.
Cashier: Why dont you fill out this address card. 

Ross: Oh, okay.
Cashier: I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.
Rachel: Oh yeah! Actually, thats one of the reasons why were not a couple.

Ross: I chose those, Im a paleontologist.
Cashier: Really?! That is so cool!
Rachel: Oh. Oh yeah, dont get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like hes a doctor, but hes not.

Cashier: Oh no-no, Im fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the new Walter Alvarez book?
Ross: Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
Rachel: Oh my God! Im standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and Im bored.

Rachel: No! Im not! I-I-I just think its wrong! Its-its that ImHere I am about to pop and hes out picking up some shop girl at Sluts R Us!
Phoebe: Is that a real place?  Are they hiring?
Chandler:  Hey Phoebe!  Fatty!

Phoebe: Wait, I think I know someone who does that.
Chandler: Me! I do that. So Seriously, do I look okay? Im little nervous.
Rachel: Oh yeah! You reallyYou look great.

Monica: I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
The Food Critic: I dont see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
Joey: Either eat it, or be in it.

Monica: Spoon?  So, what do you think?
The Food Critic: Im torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal. 
Joey: Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; theres a new class comin in.
The Cooking Teacher: Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce? 

Rachel: All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
Ross: My son? Pretty serious.  Oh hey Katie!  What uh, what are you doing here?
Katie: Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this. 

Joey: All right.
The Cooking Teacher:  Oh! Something smells good over at Monicas station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! Youve never made this before?
Monica: Oh no! I dont know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what its called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.

The Cooking Teacher: Okay Joey, youre up next.  This are good! This is amazing! You get an A!
Joey: I can an A? In-in school?  Hey, Im a dork.
Monica: Joey! Im so proud of you!

The Cooking Teacher: If youre a professional chef, what are you doing taking Introduction to Cooking?

Monica: Im-Im sorry, its just that umm Well I-I cook at this restaurant, Alessandros, and umm I just got a really bad review

The Cooking Teacher: Very much.

Joey: What the hell!
Monica: Okay.
The Acting Teacher: All right, lets start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?

Joey: Yeah, yeah, its already generating Oscar buzz.
Phoebe: I started that!

Chandler: Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
Rachel: Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? Cause Ill do it.
Monica: What are you doing here so early?

Rachel: They sent me home from work. They were like, "Start your maternity leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby." Well yknow what? Screw em! If they dont want me there, Ill just hang out with you guys.
Phoebe: Or you can do volunteer work.
Joey: Hello?
Estelle: Joey! Its Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere.

Joey: Definitely not invisible.
Monica: Well, well Ross didnt care enough to be here, so I think hes out. You snooze you lose.
Chandler: Hes not snoozing, hes teaching a class.

Monica: Star in a movie.
Phoebe: Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you?  Phoebe, Phoebe.
Joey: Well uhI think I want to take Chandler.

Phoebe:  Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-PhoebeBurrrrr! 
Chandler: You really want to take me?
Joey: Yeah! Yeah! I mean Im sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but yknow Chandler always supported my career. Hes paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.

Chandler: So youre never actually going to pay me back?
Monica: Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots youre gonna take him? Joey, I dont think youre comprehending just how slutty this dress is!
Joey: Its not just the stuff he paid for, I mean its-its everything. Yknow? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didnt get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didnt believe in myself.

Chandler: I always knew you were gonna make it. Im so proud of you.
Joey: Thanks. That means a lot to me.
Phoebe: Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.

Joey:  Im gonna go shave. 
Chandler:  Yeah well, Im gonna go spit. 
Rachel: Oh, I have to pee. If I dont come out in five minutes its because Ive choked to death on the potpourri stink. 
Phoebe: When she comes out, you hold her nose, Ill blow in her mouth, and the kid will just  right out of her.
Monica: Shes over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?

Phoebe: Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, youre still pregnant. Oh, Im sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Yknow what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.
Rachel: Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy. 
Monica: Damnit! Damnit!! Heres your fifty bucks! 

Phoebe: Until then, General Grant, why dont you set up camp  right there.
Ross:  Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctors appointment.
Monica: Shes in the bathroom.

Ross: Really? You dont think thats a little inappropriate. 
Phoebe: Good God man dont anger it.
Rachel: Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.

Rachel: Eh, just a tad.
Dr. Long: Youre about 80 percent effaced, so youre on your way. It still could last a little while longer. If youre anxious there are a few ways to help things along.
Ross: Do them!!

Monica: Hey!
Ross: Hey.
Rachel: Hi!

Monica: What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
Rachel: No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
Ross: Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.

Rachel: Well, there is one thing that we havent tried, but someone thinks that,  "That will open up a can of worms."
Monica: Well what is it? What is it? If its gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.
Ross: Its sex.

Monica: Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that youre gonna have the baby and I dont want to lose again!
Ross: What?! While shes been going through this hell, youve been making money?! Youre betting on your friend staying in this misery?! 
Rachel: Ill take that bet.

Ross: Can I get some of that action?
Monica: Wait a minute! Now Im betting against all three of you?
Rachel: Oh honey, dont worry. I really do feel like tomorrows the day.

Ross: No, but come on, were off to a great start arent we? I knew Id get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!
Phoebe: Oh you made it!

Marc: Julies cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, thats about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
Julie: Have you felt Rachels cervix Ross?
Rachel:  No, I dont think well be doing that.
Ross:  Were not gonna do that.

Julie: Well, if you like you can feel Rachels and then feel mine to compare.
