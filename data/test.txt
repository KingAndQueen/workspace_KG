Mike: To see who goes first, you got a quarter?
Monica:  No...  Either of you girls got a quarter?
Chandler: Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
Phoebe:  Monica, you call it.

Monica: AH YEAAAAH!
Chandler:  Do you really find this attractive on him?
Phoebe:  Oh, yeah!  Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?

Chandler: I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
Phoebe: C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!
Monica: Oh, damn it!

Phoebe:  I sleep with him!
Mike:  Game, point!
Monica:  Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?

Mike: And that's how it's done! 
Chandler: Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and 
Monica: Best out of three?

Mike: That's what I'm thinking.
Chandler: Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
Monica:  Serve the ball, chump! 

Mr. Oberblau: I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks. If you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be  just nifty!
Ross: Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man. 
Woman: Jarvis?

Mr. Oberblau:  Oh, you're back...  this is my wife, Nancy.
Ross: Get Out!
Charlie: Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?

Ross:  Hey, you ok?
Charlie: I guess. There was um...  there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone  else.
Paleontologist:  Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.

Ross: Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
Charlie: Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?
Professore Clerk: Or we could throw you both in now!

Mike: Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
Chandler:  Ok, look! Enough is enough!
Monica: No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!

Monica: No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off!  Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh!  Oh my God! I can't play!
Mike: So you forfeit?
Phoebe: Mike wins?

Monica: What?
Chandler: Because I'm gonna play for ya.
Phoebe: You can't do that!
Mike: Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.

Phoebe: Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.
Monica:  Honey, you don't have to do this.
Chandler:  Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.

Chandler: All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.
Mike: Ok!
Monica: Oh my God! You're good!
Phoebe: It's like watching porn!

Ross: I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea.  Or-or not! 
Rachel: What?
Monica: Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...? 
Chandler: You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.

Monica: I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
Chandler: You're on!
Phoebe: Hey!

Monica: What's up?
Phoebe: Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want...
Ross: ... finally...

Phoebe: Sounds like he's with someone.
Chandler: He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
Monica: Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.
Charlie: Ooh... Dr. Geller!
Ross: God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.

Monica: Oh my God, that's Charlie!
Chandler: She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
Phoebe: Oh that tart... floozy... giant...

Monica: No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!
Phoebe: Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.
Rachel:  Ooh... I loveBarbados! 
Joey: Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!

Rachel: I know, I'm her!
Phoebe:  Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!
Monica: What?

Phoebe: Get over here!
Rachel: ooh...
Chandler: Wow!
Monica:  Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!

Monica:  Thank you.
Rachel: Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
Joey: Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...

Rachel: What? Ross and Charlie?  Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?
Monica: I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
Chandler: How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!

Monica: Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.
Chandler: Okay Buckwheat!
Phoebe: You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free porn! 
Ross: Weh...sigh
Charlie: uhm... Is everything okay?

Ross: Alright, I'm gonna go find them...  I just need a... need a before I can... you know.  Grandma... grandma... grandma...  Okay, I see you later.
Charlie: Okay...
Phoebe: That's the door. He's gone...
Chandler: And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
Monica: Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!

Ross: Hey, what are you guys doing?
Phoebe: Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel.  I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort and Spa... 
Monica:  Yeah, we had a great time, thank you! 
Chandler:  Bye!

Ross:  Rach, you there? 
Joey: Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?
Rachel: Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant.  That's not nonchalant!

Joey: No idea what it means.
Rachel: Oh... okay, just hide!
Ross:  Rach?

Rachel: Yeah, sure... 
Joey: I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
Phoebe: Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.
Ross: And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.

Rachel: How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?
Monica, Chandler and Phoebe: YE-AH!
Phoebe: Now, what is this?

Rachel: Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!
Phoebe: Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?
Joey: Well, he's with Charlie now.
Monica: Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?

Joey:  You're a pain in my ass, Geller!
Rachel: All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...
Chandler: Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?

Rachel: Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...
Joey: Well, maybe I can help. 
RachelRoss: Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again... 

Joey: Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...
Both: Yeah
Ross: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!

Ross: Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.
Phoebe: Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...
Monica: Check it out!

Phoebe: Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!
Chandler: Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
Monica: What do you think?

Chandler: I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
Monica: Don't you just love it?
Ross: Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
Charlie: It's so... something... You go girlfriend!

Ross: I thought so.
Monica: And listen to this... 
Chandler: What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
Joey: Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.

Chandler: Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
Joey: Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
Ross: Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.

Joey: I understand...
Ross: No, I'll do it. 
Chandler: Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
Phoebe: Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...
Mike: You should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 'cause items may shift during...

Phoebe: You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.
Ross: Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".
Charlie: Okay... Good luck.
Rachel: Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
Joey: I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.

Rachel: Still nervous?
Joey: I'm gonna get the lasagna.
Ross: Hey Rach...

Rachel: Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah! 
Ross: Hey!
Joey: Hey!

Ross: Thanks!
Joey: Yeah.
Rachel: So hi!

Ross: Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
Rachel: Excuse me!  You didn't tell him, did you?
Joey: I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.

Rachel: Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
Joey: Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
Phoebe: Hi, Mike's place.
Mike: Hey, it's Mike.

Phoebe: Enchant 
Monica: Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these...  Ow!
Chandler: You go back to work tomorrow night, right?

Monica: And the eye!
Ross:  Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you.  Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? 
Rachel: That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.

Ross: Duh, you think? 
Phoebe: Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.
Precious: I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?

Precious: Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell. 
Phoebe: You're welcome!
Chandler: Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?
Monica: Not really. 

Monica: Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
Joey: Hey!
Rachel: Hi!

Joey: Stop saying good night.
Rachel: Okay.
Monica: Look what I found in the drawer...  And you said I'd never wear this...
Chandler: Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?

Joey: But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.
Rachel: No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
Joey : Dude, chill!  Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.

Rachel: Ross, say something. Anything.
Ross: So you two are..?
Joey and Rachel: Yeah.

Ross: And have you .. ed?
Joey: No, no, no!
Rachel: No, no, no!

Joey: No, no!
Rachel: Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.
Ross: I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?

Rachel: No, but you know what I mean.
Ross: Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you.  I'm fine!
Joey: Really?

Ross: Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!! 
Joey: I do like fajitas.
Monica: God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
Chandler: There's a hair in my coffee.
Phoebe: Hey guys!

Monica: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.
Chandler: You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.

Monica: Which one is which again?
Frank Jr.: Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him.
Monica : "Willing to adopt triplets?" No!
Joey: Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
Rachel: Well, what would we be doing?

Joey: Hey, Charlie!
Rachel: Hey.
Charlie: Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?

Rachel: Oh, you bet.
Joey: So, did you bring a little something for Ross?
Charlie: Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.

Joey: Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..
Ross: I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie!  Hi Joey.  And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend.  I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know.  Come, please come in. Come in.
Rachel: Okay, well, we brought you some wine.

Ross: You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
Phoebe: Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.
Frank Jr.: Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.

Phoebe: What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?
Monica: Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
Colleen: Oh, please, we're happy to help.
Bill: We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
Chandler: So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?

Chandler: I mean, you have a lovely home.
Monica: Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.
Colleen: Well, actually, I think this might help.

Colleen: Everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.
Monica: Thank you.  I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
Bill: I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.
Chandler: That's great.  Can I see the book?

Chandler: You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
Monica: It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
Colleen: The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.

Colleen: I would have told him to do it too.
Monica: Can I adopt you?
Chandler: Hey, you must be Owen.
Owen: Yeah.

Chandler: I got nothing.
Ross: The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.
Rachel: Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.

Ross: My fajitas!!
Rachel: Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.
Charlie: Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic.

Charlie: Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?
Ross: Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
Rachel: Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!

Ross: That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
Phoebe: Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?
Frank Jr.: No, of course we're not.

Phoebe: Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.
Frank Jr. : Look at them! Aw. I love you so much.  Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up!
Chandler: Where are Bill and Colleen?
Monica: They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?

Chandler: I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
Monica: Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!
Colleen: Hey.
Bill: Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.

Colleen: I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.
Chandler: But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
Owen: I'm adopted?!

Chandler: See? Intuitive!
Bill: What? Where did you hear that?
Owen: He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.

Chandler: I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."
Owen: He isn't?!
Chandler : We have to get out of here, baby!
Ross: Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
Rachel: Ooy.

Ross: Totally.
Rachel: Ross, you don't seem okay.
Ross : I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.
Charlie: Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.

Charlie: Bye.
Ross: Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!
Rachel: You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.

Ross: I don't even know what that's for.
Joey: You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
Rachel: Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

Joey: And we're okay?
Monica: Hey, Phoebs
Phoebe: Hey.

Monica: What?
Phoebe: Still, he had to find out sometime.
Chandler: Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?

Chandler: ...and beer!!
Monica:  Hey!
Ross and Chandler: Hey!

Monica:  Hey sweetie! 
Ross:  WOW!
Chandler: Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!

Ross: Thanks.  Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video...  florist. 
Phoebe: Hey!
Chandler: Hey Pheebs!
Monica: Hey Phoebe!

Phoebe: Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town.
Monica: I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!
Chandler: Who's Amanda?

Monica:   Chandler gets pedicures!
Chandler: Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
Phoebe: You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone?  "Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"

Monica: Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh!  Have you ever done that?
Chandler: No, had it done to me though. Feels good !
Assistant: Alright Mr. Geller! Right this way! So, how dark do you wanna be? We have one, two or three. 
Ross: Well... I like how you look, what are you?

Ross:  I'm an eight!
Rachel: Thanks for dinner. 
Joey: I thought you paid.  Ha, guess we wont be going back there!

Joey: Whats the matter?
Rachel: I am sorry, I dont know, I am sorry, I dont know why I did that!
Joey and Rachel: Okay

Joey:  Uh, was that good for you?
Monica:  No, no, dont get it. Let the machine pick up. 
Phoebe: Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.

Monica: It could be Amanda!
Phoebe: Oh, youre right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!
Amanda: Hello Monica. Its Amanda calling again. I am in the neighborhood hoping I can pop by your flat!

Monica: You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!
Amanda: Lets see.. to assure you get this directly, ring me back on my mobile.
Phoebe: Ok, dont hold thy breath!
Chandler: Hello? Is someone on the line?

Amanda: Yes, I was looking for Monica.
Chandler: Hang on, shes right here.  Someone's on the phone, for ya.
Monica: We werent picking up, its Amanda!

Chandler:  I get pedicures!
Monica: Hi Amanda! Actually now... its... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night?  Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!
Phoebe: Why, why, why didnt you just say no!

Monica: And you would?
Phoebe: I did!
Joey: Rach, you sure you wanna do this? 
Rachel: Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... its just a little weird, its you, and its me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.

Rachel: Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?
Joey:  NAH! I don't have another level!! 
Chandler: Hold on! There is something different.
Ross: I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.

Chandler: Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
Monica: How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!
Ross:  How do you count to five?

Monica: One Two Three...
Ross:  Damnit! 
Rachel:  oooh! Oh oh!

Ross:  I Know!
Rachel: oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
Chandler: How was your date with Joey?

Rachel:  No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through .
Monica:  Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!
Chandler:  You don't know! 

Phoebe: Hi!
Monica: Hi!
Amanda: Hi! 

Amanda:  No I distinctly remember you were dodging her  calls and trying to avoid seeing her. 
Monica:  You were going to cut me out?
Phoebe: Well...kinda.

Monica: Oh My God!
Amanda: Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like a perfect arse!
Phoebe: Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".

Monica: Nope! 
Joey:  Hey!
Rachel: Hey! Got champagne?

Joey:  Soldier down!
Monica: We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
Chandler: If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
Phoebe: Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?

Monica: I have nothing to say to you.
Amanda:  Wow, my flat is twice this size!
Phoebe: Please, Monica? In the hall?

Amanda: Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly.
Chandler: Well, aren't you a treat.
Monica: I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?
Phoebe: It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.

Monica: Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.
Phoebe: Yeah, I guess you're right.
Amanda: Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training.
Glenda: Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and...
Ross: I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.

Ross: OH! SON OF A BITCH!
Rachel: What is the matter with us?
Joey: Well, I know what's the matter with me.

Rachel: No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?
Joey: I don't know.
Chandler: That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!

Rachel: No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...
Joey: Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?
Chandler: Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.

Chandler: I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.
Rachel: Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
Joey: Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.

Joey: Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.
Chandler: Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
Ross: Go away! I don't want to see anybody.

Monica:  Hey guys!
Ross, Rachel and Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.

Monica: That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!
Rachel: Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
Ross: Yeah!

Rachel: We're having a party.
Monica: Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?
Ross: No.

Rachel: No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!
Chandler: Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
Ross: C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
Monica: Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.

Chandler: There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
Rachel: Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
Ross: Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.

Rachel: And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
Monica: All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
Chandler: Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...

Rachel: You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.
Phoebe: Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!
Ross:  Hey guys!
Rachel and Phoebe: Hi!

Ross: Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
Rachel: Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.
Phoebe: Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!

Ross: When they see this you'll be 52!
Joey: And starting to think about settling down!
Rachel: Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?

Joey: Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says "El-moo"!  Yeah... that's a funny cup!
Monica: Hey!
Chandler: Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
Rachel: Oh, she's still napping

Chandler: Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.
Rachel: Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.
Monica: All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!

Rachel: No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.
Monica: Are you freaking kidding me, Green?
Jack and Judy: HI!
Ross:  Hey!

Monica: So glad you came!
Jack: I can't believe Emma is already one!
Judy:  I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to take him to the emergency room! 
Ross:  There's something you didn't know about your dad!
Joey: Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.

Jack: Which one are you?
Monica: I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
Chandler: I know, what are we gonna do?

Monica: I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
Chandler: I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
Joey: Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents! 
Phoebe: So youre gonna... hit on her?

Joey: But equally real!
Rachel: Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?
Phoebe: Sure, yeah!

Joey:  O K.
Rachel:  All right, lets get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
Ross: Oh, great!
Phoebe:  Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?

Joey: Uh, why, its a...  one of her favorites, uh,  Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depression eesh!  Love you forever. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed  in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang Ill love you forever, Ill like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby youll be. . And while he rocked her, he sang Ill love you forever, Ill like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby youll be.
Rachel:  Wow! That was amazing!
Ross: Thank you so much for that gift!
Chandler : I was not ready for this today!

Ross: Amazing... amazing.
Rachel: Oh, Phoebe, Im sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.
Phoebe: Thats right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For theres no greater gift, than the gift of music.  Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!

Judy: Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!
Ross : Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!
Rachel: Ross, um, dont forget to get a shot of Emmas cake. Its in a box in the fridge.
Ross: Sure.

Rachel: Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
Joey : Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?
Judy: Jack, look at this.
Jack: I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!
Ross: I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
Rachel : No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughters birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!

Ross: Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the babys face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!
Rachel: Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home...  Joey, don't touch it!!
Joey: I'm so confused!

Rachel:  Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!
Chandler: To be fair this one does have nuts.
Ross: Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
Monica: Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!

Ross: Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh?  Ok!
Chandler: Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
Monica: We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!

Chandler: We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. 
Monica: Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.
Phoebe: And you know, I have a massage client soon.
Ross: You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?

Monica: Alright, 5 more minutes.
Ross:  Hello?  Oh no! What happened?  Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right there. 
Chandler: Was that Emma? Is she up?

Ross: No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
Phoebe: Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.
Monica: No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us  We've been complaining the longest!

Ross: Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves! 
Joey: Got it!  Hey hey hey!  Where do you think you're going?
Chandler: To the bathroom!

Joey: Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li... Wait a minute, there is a window in there!
Phoebe: Oh no! He's not getting away that easy! 
Chandler:  What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! 

Judy: Nighty-night!
Joey: Bye, bye.
Phoebe: Joey? How could you just let them leave?

Joey: A monologue? I don't have..  I got it.   Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!
Phoebe: Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!
Monica: Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!

Phoebe: Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!
Monica: No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
Joey: Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.

Monica:  Ok, ten.
Joey: Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?
Phoebe: No, lets just draw straws.

Joey: Right.
Monica: Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!
Phoebe:  Yeah!! Let's do that!
Chandler:  That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!

Monica: Everybody get your toys! 
Phoebe: Ok! I want the dolphin!
Chandler: Thats a bear.

Phoebe: I'm too excited!
Monica: Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go  from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!
Joey: Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys! 
Chandler: Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!

Phoebe: Go! Go!
Joey: Come on robot!
Monica:  What are you barking at?

Monica: Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
Chandler: I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
Joey: Way to go robot!
Phoebe: Good job Alan!

Chandler: I was kidding.
Monica: I wasn't. Let's get going!
Phoebe: Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?

Chandler: No, not yet.
Phoebe: Oh good, I didn't miss the party.
Monica: What about your massage client?

Joey:  I've been here the whole time!
Ross: Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
Rachel: I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!
Chandler: Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.

Rachel: What?
Chandler: Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? 
Emma: Wo-ish. 

Rachel: Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
Monica: Thanks!
Ross: Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.
Chandler: Let's do it, come on!

Rachel: I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
Joey: No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!
Monica: Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.

Rachel: Of course, I'd be honored!
Chandler: Thanks!
Monica: Thank you!
Joey: U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.

Chandler: Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
Monica: Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with the words".
Joey: Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!

Monica: You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
Joey: Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby adoption decider people..."
Chandler: So excited about your letter!
Phoebe: Hey!
All: Hey Phoebe!

Joey: Hey!
Monica: Wow! Don't you look nice?!
Phoebe: Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
Rachel: OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...

Ross: Still sharp as a tack!
Amy: Um... Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy. Amy, this is Charlie.
Charlie: Hi!

Ross: Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants! 
Rachel: Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh!  Wow! You remember Joey?
Amy: Yeah! Hey, sure! The "Days of Our Lives" guy!
Joey: That's right, yeah.

Amy: You're not good!
Joey: Always nice to meet a fan!
Rachel: So now, what are you doing here?

Amy: Hey, your English is getting better!!
Ross:  Oh my God!
Joey: I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.

Rachel: But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
Joey: Ah, look whos back!  Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?
Amy: Well, Im staying with you guys!

Joey: Yeah, Monica made us!
Rachel: Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I dont think I would be the person that I am today if it wasnt for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know its gonna take patience, but thats ok.
Amy: Good morning.

Joey: Yeaah.
Rachel: Amy, thats what I was supposed to wear today, thats why I hung it on the door.
Amy: Oh, sweety, you cant pull this off.

Phoebe: Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
Chandler: I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
Monica: Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.
Ross: Seriously?

Chandler: Word!
Phoebe: Well, mine was worse than that.
Rachel: Well, what happened?

Phoebe: Well, thats what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!
Monica: Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
Rachel: Phoebe, thats huge!
Ross: Well, do you wanna marry him?

Phoebe: Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I dont think hes ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!
Chandler: She's right! If I were a guy and...  Did I just say if I were a guy..?
Monica: Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!

Phoebe: Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?
Monica: I proposed to Chandler!  Alright, moving on...
Chandler: Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!

Monica: Thank you.
Phoebe:  Well, do you think I should propose?
Rachel: I think it could be kind of great!
Ross: Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!

Phoebe: Ok, ok, so how should I do it?
Monica: How about at a game, on the big screen?
Rachel:  Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? 

Monica: What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!
Phoebe: Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?
Chandler: Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think? 
Amy:  Nana is on the phone 
Rachel:  Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!

Amy: She did? Who got her condo in Boca?
Rachel:  Hello?  Oh, it's our nanny!  Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye!  That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
Ross: No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?

Rachel:  Can any of you watch Emma?
Monica: No, sorry sweety..
Phoebe: No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..

Chandler: Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
Joey: Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
Monica: You dropped it off?

Joey: Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later! 
Monica: Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
Chandler: It's ok, it's ok. You know what?  I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. 

Monica:  They thought Joey was a child?
Chandler: She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
Amy: Hi!

Monica: Hey, what did you guys do today?
Amy: Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.
Chandler: That sounds like fun.

Amy: Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?
Chandler: I think she looks cute.  ... but I am wrong!
Rachel: Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.

Amy: Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?
Rachel: Ugh. 
Ross: Hey guys. 
Monica and Chandler: Hi Ross.

Ross: Why not?
Monica: Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
Chandler: Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?

Ross: Did she  do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!
Rachel: I know, I know, and you were right Ross.  You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
Amy: Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs to have a cool fun aunt!
Monica: I'm a cool, fun aunt!

Amy:  O-Okay!
Chandler: Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
Rachel: I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?

Amy: Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist.
Rachel:  What?
Ross: That's not a thing!

Mike: Why?
Phoebe: Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.
Announcer: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.

Joey: Whoo-hoo! 
Amy: You're kicking me out? 
Rachel: You put holes in my baby's ears!

Amy: You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then, I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws  And suddenly I am the bad guy?
Rachel:  Joey, where are those bags?
Joey:  She has a lot of crap!

Phoebe:  Hey...
All: Hey!
Rachel: Hi!
Ross: Pheebs, what's wrong?

Phoebe: Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this... HUGE engagement ring!
All: OH!
Rachel: My God!
Joey: Hey!

Rachel: Congratulations! Wow!!
Ross: So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or  did he cry?  Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!
Phoebe: Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.
Joey: Well, hey! Well...  Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and...  I wanna say Mike?  To Phoebe and Mike!
All: Whoo!

Phoebe: Oh, my first love! 
Rachel: Oh!
Monica: What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?

Phoebe: Dead.  Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.
Chandler: Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.
Rachel: Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?

Chandler: Hey you guys. 
Rachel: Hi!
Joey: Oh! Any word on casting yet?

Chandler: Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.
Joey: What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
Rachel: I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.

Joey: Just pass it to your boss!
Chandler: He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!
Rachel: Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.

Ross: I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?
Charlie:  Sorry, looks like it's just him.
Benjamin: Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!

Ross: Well, I... I am having a good hair day.
Benjamin: So good to see you.
Charlie: Me too. 

Ross: It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,  whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.
Benjamin: Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice! 
Charlie: Shall we? .

Benjamin: You weren't there!
Ross: No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm.
Charlie: Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal, while I go to the ladies room?

Phoebe: No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!
Monica: Wow, what's the bad news!
Rachel: Who's Gladys?

Phoebe: Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!
Monica: Huh!
Rachel: Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...

Monica: But I insist!
Rachel: But I insist harder!
Phoebe: Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. . Tails! Monica, she's yours!

Chandler: Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
Joey:  You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why? 
Rachel: Well, this is going well. 

Phoebe:  Well, Gladys say hello to your new home! 
Monica:  Oh, my! 
Rachel:  Wow!  Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly? 

Monica:  I haven't really settled on a spot yet!
Rachel: Well, hey! How about right above the TV? . That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
Phoebe:  Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.

Monica:  I like that poster!
Phoebe: Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
Rachel:  Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!

Rachel: She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal.  And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.
Joey: GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
Monica: Hey! I sold that to Joey.

Rachel: She's mine!
Monica: She's mine!
Phoebe: You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore.  Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis. 

Monica: Oh my God!
Rachel: Excellent!
Joey: Now, what do you say?
Chandler: Lying is wrong!

Benjamin: Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.
Ross: No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.
Charlie: Benji?

Benjamin: Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life.
Ross: Too little, too late, Benji!
Charlie: I can't believe this.

Benjamin: I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me? 
Ross:  No!
Charlie: Yes!

Ross: or...
Benjamin: Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back?
Charlie: Maybe...

Ross: Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
Charlie: Oh God! I am so sorry, but...  I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know...
Benjamin:  I'm sorry too...

Ross: Hey, what are you doing?
Mike: Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.
Chandler: That's funny, we were doing the same thing!

Ross: Yeah!
Phoebe: It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!
Chandler: Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.

Phoebe: So what did you two do about it?
Chandler: It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
Ross: There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
Mike: I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.

Ross: Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
Phoebe: But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
Mike: Are you serious?

Phoebe: Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?
Mike: I think it would make me wanna marry you even more. 
Ross: I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
Chandler:  Maybe you do that next time you get married!

Joey: What's going on?
Chandler: Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
Monica:  We?

Chandler: Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
Monica: And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
Joey: Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.

Chandler:  Little people?
Joey:  Celebrity.
Monica: Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?

Charity guy: Well, this is very generous!
Phoebe: And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
Mike: Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.

Phoebe: Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
Charity guy: Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.
Mike: Not necessary.

Phoebe: Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
Mike: And "X" is spelled uhm... "Mike Hannigan".
Charity guy: Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.

Monica: Ok.
Chandler: Here we go. Stand up straight.  Big smile. 
Phoebe: Hello, is this the creepy residence?

Monica: Yay!
Chandler: But you already gave all your money to charity!
Phoebe: Well, I'll just ask for it back!

Mike: We're seriously asking for our money back?
Phoebe: It's for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting.
Charity guy: Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don't think that that's ever happened before.
Phoebe : Gay, go.
Mike : Oh my God, I love your shirt!

Phoebe: Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn't want, but it turns out we do.
Charity guy: So you're asking us to refund your donation to the children?
Mike: Yeah! This feels really good.

Laura: Oh, water would be fine.
Monica: Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We're really excited about getting this process started.
Chandler: Oh, because we love kids. Love em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.

Laura: You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples in the building adopting?
Monica: Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs. 
Chandler: But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.

Joey: Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...
Chandler:  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
Laura: What's going on?

Chandler: Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. 
Joey: Guys!?
Monica: Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!

Joey: Everything doesn't sound fine!
Laura: Is he alright out there by himself?
Chandler: Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.

Laura: Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need up to here...
Monica:  Why don't I show you the baby's room?
Chandler: What the hell are you doing?
Joey: Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.

Chandler: We don't have a code word.
Joey: We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word for danger.
Monica: So that was the baby's room. 

Monica:   Some people don't get him, but I think he's really funny! .
Joey:  I did not care for that!
Chandler:  You have to get out of here. You slept with our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so she can't see you.

Chandler: What?
Joey: I forgot my bat.
Laura: Oh my God!

Chandler: And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat! 
Laura: What are you doing here?
Joey:  Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!

Laura: Are you friends with him?
Chandler: I can explain... Joey...
Joey: Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back here. I can't believe you never called me.

Laura:  I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed...
Chandler: Oh, that's really ok.
Monica: Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.

Phoebe:  We're back!
Charity guy: Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you're looking for is an ATM.
Mike: No, no, we're here to give the money back.

Phoebe: Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here.  No... Oh God... Oh!
Charity guy: If I haven't said so already sir,  congratulations!
Mike:  Ok, look! Enough! Alright? I'm stepping in. I'm putting my foot down! As your future husband I'm going to make this decision for us.  Now... what do you think we should do?

Monica: Hey guys!
Rachel: Hi! 
Phoebe: Hey!

Monica: We need to talk to you about something.
Chandler: Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
All: What?
Phoebe: Hey!
Ross: Are you kidding?

Chandler: No, no! We made this decision together. 
Ross: She's putting words in your mouth!
Joey: Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
Rachel: I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
Monica: No, it's not!

Rachel: It's not?  When was she born?
Phoebe: Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
Monica: Thank you, Pheebs!

Phoebe: Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.
Monica: That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!
Chandler: Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!

Phoebe: You're not making the pies yourself?
Monica: No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I entered this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
Rachel: Did you at least win the contest?

Monica: This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year "me"!
Phoebe: Hey Rach.
Rachel: Yeah.

Monica: Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these  Not with soap!! 
Chandler: You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
Ross: Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!
Joey: Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!

Ross: Dude, I wanted him to guess.
Joey: Oh.
Chandler: Oh my God!

Joey: Center ice.
Ross: Did I do something to you?
Chandler: Hmm, the game's at one.

Ross: So? 
Chandler: Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.
Joey: So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.

Chandler: Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!
Ross: He's right, man.
Joey: Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four. 

Chandler: Okay.  And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
Joey: That's some gentle comedy, dude. 
Ross: We're still going at the game, right?

Host: This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...
Phoebe: Hey.
Rachel: Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!

Joey: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!
Ross: Hey!
Phoebe: Oh!

Joey: You are not at Thanksgiving?
Rachel: No... 
Phoebe: No, we're late!

Rachel: What are you doing here!
Ross: We're late too! 
Joey: We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time 
Phoebe: Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!

Ross: Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
Phoebe: Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!
Rachel: And I won!

Ross: You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
Phoebe: And it looks like she put makeup on her!
Joey: Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...

Ross: So this is an annual thing?
Joey:  Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
Phoebe: You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!

Ross: Yeah. What are we gonna do?
Rachel: Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.
Joey: All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae. 
Phoebe: Alright, what are we gonna say?

Ross: Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
Phoebe: Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!
Joey: No. Here 

Monica: Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
Rachel: Alright, Emma is napping...  what happened to your shirt?
Ross: I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
Phoebe: We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time!  OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.

Ross:  We know you're out there. 
Joey:  Who do you think its from?
Rachel: Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.

Ross: Well, let's just go in there and face them.
Phoebe: Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy. 
Joey: I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.
Rachel: Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first.  Ready? .

Joey: Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played. 
Rachel: Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.
All: Alright, okay. 
Phoebe: It's locked.
Ross: Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: "Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy". 

Rachel: Alright, come on...  Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.
Monica: No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
Chandler: Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that...  what happens to cranberry sauce?

Monica:  Nothing. It's fine.
Chandler:  Oh thank God!
Ross: Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.

Chandler:  That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
Ross:  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!! 
Rachel: You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. 
Joey: I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that. 
Monica: That's all the turkey you're gonna get.

Ross: How are we gonna decide who gets this?
Joey:  WATER BALLOON! 
Phoebe: What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
Rachel:  Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.

Phoebe: Oh yeah!
Monica: Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
Chandler: Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. 
Rachel: Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS. 
Ross: That's worse than no food.

Chandler: Please let me stay on this side of the door.
Rachel: Oh, I know... I still have my old key!  We can just unlock the door.
Phoebe: Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.

Rachel: You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together. 
Joey:  Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.
Ross: I don't know...

Joey: I'm telling ya...  I can do it.
Ross:   Yeah, he can do it!
Rachel: Oh!

Joey: Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...
Chandler: The cranberries...?
Monica: Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!

Joey: Come on you guys, we want you to know we're  very very sorry.   Right guys?
Ross: I feel terrible.
Phoebe and Rachel: So, so sorry.

Joey:  Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
Chandler: The floating heads do make a good point.
Monica: Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
Rachel: So bad.
Ross : So bad.
Phoebe: So bad.

Monica: Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
Ross: Really girls, not cool.
Chandler: Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.
Joey: Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!

Ross: It's a day to be thankful.
Joey:  Don't make me come up there!
Monica: It's too late for apologies.

Joey: Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
Chandler: That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
Rachel: Ewww, is that what that is?

Joey: Sorry!
Phoebe: Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.
Rachel: Yeah! I'll cook!
Ross: Yeah! Let's go out.

Rachel: Hey!
Joey: Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
Monica: The three of us?

Joey: No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
Phoebe: I'll pull you through.
Ross: Okay.

Joey: Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.
Monica: Alright, well, this does not change anything.  Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
Chandler: Uhm, we've got turkey grease.

Joey: Interesting...
Monica: Chandler, where are your tools?
Chandler:  Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!

Monica: I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
Rachel: I lent them to Ross.
Ross: I gave them to Joey.
Joey: I left them at the park.

Monica: Oh!
Ross:  I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
Phoebe: I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.

Ross: Nice!
Monica: Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.
Joey: It's really starting to hurt.
Chandler: Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!
Phoebe: Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.

Joey: Yeah! Come on!
Joey and Chandler: PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
Chandler: My cranberries!

Chandler: Are you serious? 
Monica: There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!
Rachel: I'm so happy for you!

Rachel: To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
Ross: I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
Phoebe: I know. Have you considered pageanting?
Monica: I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby. 
Joey: Oh, I know how you feel...

Chandler: Hi!
Ross: Hey!
Monica: Hey!

Chandler: We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.
Phoebe: Oh, right! Your adoption interview!
Monica: Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
Joey: I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!

Chandler: And so incorrect!
Monica: She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
Ross: Come on, she's gonna love you guys!

Chandler: I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
Joey: But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?
Monica: Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!

Rachel:  Hey, who's Phoebe with?
Joey: I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with.   Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!

Joey: Saraaah.
Ross:  Hey!
Rachel: Hi!

Agency guy: Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.
Monica: Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?
Chandler: Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"

Monica: Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
Erica:  Hi...
Chandler: Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.

Erica: Hi.
Agency guy: I'll let you get acquainted.
Chandler: Ok.

Phoebe:  You wouldnt let her have a grape?
Rachel: Oh no! Not me! Emma!
Joey:  JOEY DOESNT SHARE FOOD!

Phoebe:  This place is awesome! 
Ross: You know, we should just go, Im not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous! 
Rachel: Ah, this place is great!

Phoebe: Wow!
Ross: Rach, come on, Im not gonna wear any of this!  Nothing silver. . Ok? Nothing with hair!  And nothing with padlocks on it! .
Rachel: Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful!

Chandler: So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wifes a reverend, thats important to you?
Erica: Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought who better then a minister to raise a child!
Monica: Amen.

Chandler: Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
Monica: Uh, good hands.  Healing hands.
Erica: Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?

Monica: It says "Do it!" And behold she did adopt unto them a baby. And it was good.
Erica: Wow.
Chandler: Yeah, wow.

Erica:  Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.
Chandler: Not for me it doesnt.
Agency guy: So, hows everything going in here?

Erica: Were great, I think I may have asked all my questions.
Agency guy: Do you have any question for Erica?
Chandler: Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?

Agency guy:  Well, then if theres nothing else, then the two of us should talk.
Erica: Actually, I dont think we have to.
Monica: We dont?

Erica: Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. . I've made my decision. I choose them.
Monica: Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?
Chandler: Yeah, I did.

Waiter: Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!
Sarah: Mmmh, those fries look delicious.
Joey: oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours. 

Joey: Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.
Waiter: Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece.
Sarah: Mmmm! Mmm!

Erica: Hi!
Adoption Agency guy: Hey.
Chandler: Hey.
Agency guy: So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it.
Monica:  I-Is... Is that a picture?

Erica: Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it. 
Monica: Look, doctor!
Agency guy: I don't understand.
Chandler: The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.

Erica: What?
Agency guy: That's impossible.
Chandler: I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.

Agency guy: I'll go check your file. Excuse me.
Erica: So who are you?
Chandler: Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
Monica: Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. 

Monica: Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!
Chandler:  It's like a giant hug.
Phoebe: Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?
Ross: Food.

Phoebe: Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
Ross: Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
Rachel: Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?
Joey: Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.

Rachel: Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
Phoebe: Oh yeah? Well, let's see.  Ok, duck down.  
Chandler:  Hello.

Ross: I just cant see Chandler cheating!
Rachel: Im telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
Joey: Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just cant believe he would do this to Monica!

Rachel: Oh, look at her, so happy!
Monica: If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
Joey: Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?

Monica: No, hes picking up dinner, why, whats up?
Phoebe: Well, look, whatever happens, were here for you and we love you.
Monica : All right...
Ross: We think Chandler might be having an affair.

Monica: What?
Rachel: Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
Phoebe: They went in together. So sorry.

Monica: Oh my God! Oh my God thats awful! What did you think of the house?
Phoebe: What?
Joey:  Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?

Monica: Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously...  Did you think the neighborhood was homey? 
Chandler: Hey!
Joey:  You son of a bitch!

Chandler: Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
Monica:  Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
Rachel: Who's Nancy?
Ross: What's going on?

Monica:  Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
Chandler: Yeah  I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
Joey: I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!
Phoebe: Why do you have a realtor?

Monica: Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
Joey:  What?
Rachel: Are you serious?

Monica: When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
Phoebe: So you're gonna move?
Ross: Oh my God.
Joey: Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
Rachel: What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!

Monica: And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
Chandler: ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
Ross:  So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
Phoebe: Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?

Ross: What?
Monica: And about an hour ago, we made an offer.
Chandler: Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?

Ross: You put an offer on a house? 
Monica:  It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... 
Phoebe: Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?
Chandler: I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
Joey: Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food?  Because I can stop doing that,  I really, really think I can! 

Chandler:  You know that's not the reason Joe. 
Monica: We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there.  It is beautiful, isn't it?
Rachel: Yeah it is.
Joey: What the hell are you doin'?

Rachel: Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. 
Monica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Ross: That money is mine, Green!

Rachel: You're fly is open, Geller!
Phoebe: You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Chandler: Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!

Phoebe: Hey, its your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
The Guys: We will. 
Monica: Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
Rachel: No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this. 

Monica: Every year.
Joey:  It's stuck!!!
Phoebe:  Easy. Step. How did it get on?

Joey: It smells really bad in here.
Phoebe: Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
Monica: Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God!  Who is that?

Joey: It's Joey.
Monica: I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Rachel: Oooohh thats interesting.
Chandler: If you win, we give up the birds.

Joey: Oooooh!
Monica: Deal!
Ross: What was Monicas nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?

Joey: Big fat goalie.
Ross: Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
Chandler: Dangerous Liaisons.

Ross: Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Joey: Everyday use.
Chandler: Fancy.

Joey: Guest.
Chandler: Fancy guest.
Ross: Two seconds...

Ross: 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
Monica: Its umm, it has something to do with transponding.
Rachel: Oh-oh-oh, hes a transponce...transpondster!

Monica: NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Rachel: Yknow what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
Joey: Hey, dont get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!

Rachel: Well it stupid, unfair question!
Ross: Dont blame the questions!
Chandler: Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!

Ross: Chandler!!! Chandler!!!  Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Chandler:  Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! 
Monica:  Hey Ross. What's up bro?

Ross: What the hell are doing?!!
Rachel:  Hey, what's-what's going on?!
Chandler: Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Joey:  Dude! He's right there!

Ross:  I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Chandler: Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Monica: I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.

Ross:  My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.  
Monica: Well, this is the last box of your clothes. Im just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Rachel: Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Phoebe: Ok, you guys, I dont mean to make things worse, but umm, I dont want to live with Rachel anymore.
Monica and Rachel: What?!

Phoebe: Youre just so mean to each other! And I dont want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Rachel: Well, Phoebe thats fine because Im not moving.
Monica: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Yknow, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but yknow Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, shell fold down the pages of the things she thinks that Id like.

Phoebe: What else?
Monica: When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Rachel: Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.

Phoebe: Thats nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Monica: When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
Rachel: Well yknow, I dont want you to be cold.

Monica: What the hell is that dog doing here?! 
Chandler: Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
All: That's so sweet.
Ross: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Rachel: And a crappy New Year.

Rachel: You can't move. You just... you just can't.
Joey: Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong. 
Phoebe: Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.
Ross: You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good. 

Rachel: Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night.
Chandler: Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
Monica: And?

Chandler: I know.
Monica: Well, there you go.
Joey: I'm really sorry you guys.
Ross: Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
Rachel: Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.
Phoebe:  You're gonna be okay?

Monica: Yeah, we'll be okay.
Ross: Love you guys. 
Joey: You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.
Chandler: That's okay, we understand.

Joey: And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
Monica: I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.
Chandler: Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.

Monica: Rachel, this is yours.
Rachel: Aah! Why? What are these for?
Chandler: You'll see.

Monica: All right, everybody open them!
Rachel: Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful. 
Phoebe: Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store. 

Monica: I know.
Ross: I love this. 
Joey: A meatball Sub? Thanks! 

Joey: Sure.
Monica: Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!
Phoebe: Great!
Ross: Really? Which one?

Monica: Or "Win, Lose or Draw".
Chandler: What did I marry into?
Joey: Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?

Monica: Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
Phoebe: Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.
Ross: Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
Joey: Seriously?

Ross:  Yeah-uh!
Monica: Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
Chandler: You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!

Ross: Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!
Chandler: Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!

Chandler: O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. 
Monica: Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
Rachel: Oh.

Monica: Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
Ross: Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
Adrienne: Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this.

Rachel: I am sooo drunk.
Monica: That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all. 
Chandler: Soo... you girls having fun?

Monica: Oh THATS ME! 
Rachel:  I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
Chandler: Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.

Roy: I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.
Rachel: So maybe something in an office.
Phoebe: Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.

Roy: Really?
Rachel:  Really?
Phoebe: Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.

Donny: Well, welcome to the Winner Circle. Joey and Gene, you guys ready?
Joey:  Yeah...
Gene:  Sure. 

Donny: Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO! 
Gene: Oak, maple, elm, birch...
Joey: I-I-I don't know. Types of trees?

Ross: Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
Monica: Oh my God! That's wild!
Chandler: Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.

Ross: Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
Chandler: You kissed her that night too?
Monica: Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.

Chandler: Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
Ross: Well, then who was on my bed?
Monica:  OH! Oh, oh! 

Chandler: No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
Phoebe: Rehearse it!
Ross: Hi! 
Mike: Thanks for coming you guys.

Ross: That is why!
Mike: Yeah.
Phoebe: So Rach.
Rachel: Yeah.

Phoebe: Where is Emma?
Rachel: Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
Monica:  Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time! 
Joey: Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
Mike's mother: Yes, we are.

Joey: Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!
Chandler:  You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
Ross: Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
Rachel: Uh... November?

Ross: I wanna say it's not looking good.
Rachel: Hey Pheebs...
Phoebe: What's up?

Rachel: Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
Chandler: Heh.
Phoebe: Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.
Ross: What? 

Rachel: Well, this is really awkward  Oh, and I can leave!
Phoebe: I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were, you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just, you just missed the cut.
Ross: Oh, man!
Chandler: This is like figure skating team all over again.  I mean synchronized swimming.  I mean- I mean the balance beam.  Help me!

Ross: FOOTBALL!
Chandler: Thank you.
Monica:  Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.
Phoebe: Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!

Monica: Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!
Ross: I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
Chandler: I know, I hate being left out of things.

Ross: And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
Mike: Hey guys, how is it going?
Chandler: Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.

Mike: Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.
Chandler: What happened?
Ross: Who cares, AND?

Mike: ...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys... 
Ross:  I'll do it!
Chandler:  M-Me, me, me!

Mike: You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.
Chandler: Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
Ross: No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch!  Huh?

Mike: You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose. 
Ross:  Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
Chandler: Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!

Joey: Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!
Ross: So, what did you decide?
Phoebe: I decided to pee.
Chandler: Mike didn't tell you? You have to choose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.

Phoebe: All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.
Ross: I'll do it! 
Monica: Ok, it's 2100 hours.  Time for your toast. 
Mike: Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?

Monica:  It's 2101 and I am not amused. . Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say. 
Phoebe: Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. . My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I...  oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because...  it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and  but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...
Monica : oh God.

Phoebe: Oh, happy my wedding day to you!
Rachel: Okie-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
Joey: Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages! 
Monica: Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.

Phoebe: You won awards?
Monica: Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
Ross: Hey!

Monica: She's in her room, why?
Ross: I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! .  Oh! My God! You're breathtaking! 
Rachel: What d'you want?

Phoebe: Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins? 
Monica: I know.
Mike: Hey.

Phoebe: Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!
Joey:  Hello Michael.
Mike: Joseph.

Phoebe: No! We're gonna do it my way.  Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend.  Hello? 
Joey: I'm glad we had this little talk.
Mike: Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice.  That didn't make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?

Phoebe: Okay.
Monica: Bye.
Mike: Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall? 

Chandler: You told us both we could be in the wedding? 
Rachel: Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
Ross: Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again. 

Chandler: I'll tell you at the wedding.
Rachel: Uh.
Mike: Hey, I forgot my scarf. 

Rachel: You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick. 
Mike: Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy. 
Ross: What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose. 

Rachel:  Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
Phoebe: Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!? 
Monica:  How's it going? 

Phoebe: More than I wanna get married.
Monica: Ok people, we are back in business!  Oh God, we've missed you soo much!  Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.
Joey: Hey, what are you guys gonna do?

Phoebe:  About what?
Joey: The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels. 
Monica: Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!

Monica:  Well, the club lost it's power.
Joey: Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
Rachel: Since when do you watch the news? 

Joey: Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.
Ross:  I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
Phoebe: I know.
Rachel: Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?

Monica:  OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights.  Okay, who left the ice sculpture  ON THE STEAM GRATE? 
Mike's mom: Michael!
Mike: Hey! You made it. Great! Chappy! Hi!  Hi!  Mom, I know getting married in the street isn't something you approve of...

Mike's mom: No... It's lovely. The lights and the snow. I could look at them forever. 
Mike's dad:  I crushed a pill and put it in her drink...  Come on, sweetheart.
Mike:  You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle.
Chandler: So technically, would this person be in the wedding?

Mike: I guess.
Chandler and Ross: I'll do it!
Ross: No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?
Chandler: I'm not scared.  I'll just take little Chappy and...  HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.

Ross:  Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa...  He stinks!
Monica: Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.
Mike: Oh, no! 
Joey: Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.

Monica: Really?
Joey: Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Uhh-uh...
Ross: Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.

Joey: I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.
Monica: Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.
Chandler:  I'll do it.
Ross: I'll...

Monica: So, you're ready to do this?
Phoebe: Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.
Rachel: Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey. 

Phoebe: I love you guys.
Rachel and Monica: I love you.
Monica: Okay.  It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count.  Let's get this bad boy on the road.
Chandler:  Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?

Monica: Okay Marjorie, hit it.
Rachel: Geez Ross, you could have showered.
Ross: It's the dog.

Monica: Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down!  Oh, that's me.
Chandler: Ready?
Phoebe:  Okay.

Chandler: You look beautiful.
Phoebe: Thank you.
Mike: My God! Aren't you freezing?

Joey:  Okay...
Phoebe: When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family. 
Mike: Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever. 

Phoebe: Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.
Mike: I love you too. 
Ross: Uh Joey...
Joey: Yeah?

Ross: Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
Joey: Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?
Phoebe: I do.

Phoebe: Hi
All: Hey! Hi!
Rachel: How was the honeymoon?

Rachel: Oh!
Chandler: So, where's Mike?
Phoebe: Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!
Joey: Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help.

Phoebe: Oh, why? What's up?
Joey: I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my rsum, I'm fluent in.
Ross: Joey, you shouldn't lie on your rsum.
Monica: Yeah, you really shouldn't.  By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?

Ross:  It was ok...
Rachel: I did not know you spoke French.
Phoebe: Oui, bien sur je parle Fran?ais! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?

Rachel: Oh... you're so sexy!
Joey: Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.
Phoebe: Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.

Chandler: Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  No? Divorce?
Ross:  Hey. 
Monica: Hey.

Ross: So, why is Erica coming to visit?
Monica: Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
Chandler: Oh, those places! There's always so many people, they're being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!

Monica: Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
Ross:  Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
Rachel: Ross...

Ross: Oh my God.
Monica: Honey.
Chandler: I'm so sorry...

Phoebe: Oh, mon Dieu!
Joey: Oh, de fuff!
Monica:  Hey you guys.

Phoebe: Hi!
Joey: Hey.
Monica: I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!

Phoebe: Oh!
Monica: Joey. Erica, baby!
Joey: Hi.

Monica: Everyone. Erica, baby!
Chandler: Monica. Calm, self.
Erica: Thank you. It's really nice to meet you guys, I can't believe I'm here!
Joey: Welcome to New York City! Or should I say "ghe deu flooff New York City"?

Chandler: Why would you say that?
Phoebe: Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?
Erica: I wanna see everything! Times Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center...
Joey: Oh, you know what you should do? You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty.

Rachel: Can somebody please go in?
Nurse: Absolutely.
Ross: Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.

Rachel: Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!
Ross: I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!
Nurse: He's under sedation, so he's pretty much out.

Ross: I'm feeling better.
Rachel: Oh!  Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?
Nurse: Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phone if you'd like to speak to him.

Rachel: Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?
Ross: He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
Rachel : Ok.

Erica: Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.
Monica: Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
Chandler:  New York is awesome!

Monica: Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
Erica: Well, if there is anything else you wanna know... 
Chandler: Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father? 

Erica: No... he killed his father with a shovel.  But other than that, he's a great guy. 
Chandler: I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
Monica: Are you awake? 

Tape: Good job.
Joey: Thank you. 
Phoebe: Hey Joey.

Director: Whenever you're ready Joey.
Joey: Right.  Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.
Casting assistant: I'm sorry, what's going on?

Joey: Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!
Director: You know what. I think this audition is over. 
Phoebe:  Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am Regin Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Este Lauder.

Director: You really think this man is speaking French?
Joey: Sa-sa-saw!
Phoebe: coutez, je vais vous dire la vrit. C'est mon petit frre. Il est un peu retard. 

Phoebe: Alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui...  
Director:  Good job, little buddy. That was some really good French. But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.
Joey: Ah. All right. But my French was good?

Director: It was great.
Joey:  Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
Phoebe:  Merci. Au revoir. 

Ross: ...Valentine's day...
Both:  Oh yeah!
Rachel: Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.

Mike:  Thank you guys for having us over.
Phoebe: Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
Chandler: Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
Monica: Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.

Chandler: You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it. 
Ross:  Hey, you guys... I have great news.
Monica: Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.

Ross: Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid.
Rachel:  Hi you guys.
All: Hey.

Rachel: Ooh, Italian!  
Monica: No one wanted seconds, right?
Ross: No, no. I-I'm good.

Phoebe: Where did you go to do it?
Monica: Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
Chandler: YOU NEVER DID IT!

Monica: I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
Chandler: Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
Mike:  Here you go.
Phoebe: Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?

Mike: Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name. You've got to live with it. 
Phoebe: All right, let's see, call me Mrs. Hannigan.
Chandler:  Mrs. Hannigan?

Phoebe:  What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something?  Ooh, I like it.
Joey:  Hey guys.
Chandler: Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?

Joey: No, thank you.
Monica: All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
Chandler: Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.

Joey: You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!
Chandler: Damn it.
Monica: See you guys later.
Phoebe: Okay!

Monica:  I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
Phoebe: Good for you. That was really mature.
Joey: What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.
Mike: You're a strange kind of grown-up.

Phoebe: Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
Chandler: That's what we were gonna name the baby.
Monica: Phoebe!

Phoebe: Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.
Chandler: Hey, how'd the interview go?
Rachel: Oh! It's not good.

Chandler: That is a bad interview.
Phoebe: What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?
Rachel: Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true. 
Monica: Oh God. I'm so sorry.
Ross: Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this?  Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?

Phoebe: Ross...
Ross: I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
All : Congratulations! 

Ross: Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.
Phoebe: Can you?
Rachel: Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!

Ross: ...that center around work.
Chandler: To Ross!
All : Ross!

Monica: Thank you for letting us see the house again.
Chandler: And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
Realtor: Take as long as you want. Just let me know when you're through.  

Monica: Ah, so glad you decided to come.
Joey: Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.
Chandler: What?

Rachel:  Ross, what is taking you so long?
Ross:   I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
Mark: Rachel?

Rachel: I'm fantastic. You remember Ross? 
Mark: Sure, sure.  What's with the chair. 
Ross: Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...  

Mark:  Nice to see you.
Ross: Yeah! yeah, I got tenure! 
Rachel:  Oh my God!

Monica: Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
Chandler: Man, those two dogs are going at it!
Joey:  Hey!

Chandler: Hey.
Monica: Hey, where have you been?
Joey: Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.

Chandler: Ha! I'm just messing with you.
Joey: That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
Monica: Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?

Mike: After you, miss Banana Hammock.
Phoebe: Thank you, mister Bag.
Woman: Oh hey, how are you?

Phoebe:  Okay, I will.  This is my husband Crap Bag.
Rita: Crap Bag?
Mike: If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.

Rita: Okay. Excuse me...
Phoebe: Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?
Mike: Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.

Ross: We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
Monica: So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.
Chandler: Excuse me?

Monica: Oh, sorry!
Rachel:  Hi you guys!
Ross: Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?

Rachel: Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
Ross: Should we send something?
Chandler: How did the job stuff go?

Rachel: He offered me one.
Chandler: That's great!
Ross: Congratulations!

Jennifer: Previously on Friends...
Chandler: How did the job stuff go?
Rachel: He offered me one.
Ross:  You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.

Rachel: Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.
Ross: So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
Chandler: Or facing a bitch of a commute.

Rachel: I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want.
Chandler: My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. 
Ross: All right, we'll work it out.

Rachel: I got a really incredible job offer.
Joey: Hey, great! All right!
Phoebe: Good for you!

Rachel: It's in Paris.
Joey: What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married  Congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...
Monica: Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...

Joey: Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
Rachel: Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.
Phoebe: Of course we can. Congratulations.  Yay!  Joey...

Joey: Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me. 
Rachel: Joey...
Phoebe: You okay with this?
Chandler: Well, it makes me feel sad, but...

Phoebe: Talking to Ross.
Chandler: I see.
Ross: Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?
Monica: I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.

Ross: Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?
Monica: How is that gonna happen?
Chandler: Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?

Monica: But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
Chandler: What do you think Pheebs?
Phoebe: Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?

Chandler: You're kidding!
Monica: That's terrible!
Phoebe: Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic.  Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.

Chandler: Oh yeah? 
Phoebe: Yeah, she was just an agent.
Monica: Joey's gonna be so upset. 

Chandler: I know. He always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
Phoebe: Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.
Monica: Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?

Janice: What a small world! 
Chandler: And yet I never run into Beyonce!
Realtor: You two know each other?

Janice: Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! . So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie 
Chandler:  Don't, don't! 
Monica: No, actually, we're buying the house next door. 

Chandler:  Why!?
Monica:  I don't know why.
Janice: Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it!  Ellen, we're going to talk numbers.  

r Zelner: Who is it?
Ross:  It's me. Ron.  Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back. 
Mr Zelner: This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job.

Answering machine: Joey, this is Al T. Booker,  the guy who eats paper. I'm sure you've heard that Estelle passed away.  I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it. 
Joey: Oh my God.  Hello?
Phoebe:  Joey, it's Estelle. 

Rachel: Well, I took it.
Ross: That's great! So you're staying in New York!
Both: YAY! WHOO! YAY!

Joey: Hey!
Chandler: So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
Rachel: Oh, that sounds good!
Monica: Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?

Rachel: Oh, well. Everything that I need  is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
Monica: Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you! 
Chandler: Where's your passport?

Monica: You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?
Erica: No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out.
Ross: Hey! 

Erica: Oh, ok. I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts. 
Ross: No, no, I knew .
Monica : Okay, well, stop staring at them.

Ross: She brought them up!  I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
Erica: Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.
Monica: Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.

Ross: Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
Monica: Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
Erica: Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!

Ross: Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
Monica: Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.
Erica : I'll be right back.

Ross: What are you guys doing?
Joey: Try it, I can't feel a thing! 
Monica : Are, are you kidding? This is packing?
Chandler: We're taking a break!
Monica: From?

Chandler: Jumping on the bed?
Monica: All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
Ross: You got it! . All right, she's right, we gotta get serious.  Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!

Chandler:  What the hell is this?
Joey: Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
Ross: Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.

Phoebe: Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.
Ross: Rock on!
Phoebe : Wow, this is quite a spread!  What is all this stuff?
Monica: Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.
Joey:  Hey.
Chandler: Hey.

Ross: Great.
Joey: Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?
Monica: Yeah.
Everybody: Hey Rach, hey you.

Ross: Here she is!
Rachel : Hi you guys!
Joey: What did I just say?
Rachel: No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.
Monica: Come here, I'll make you a drink.

Ross: Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
Chandler: I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.  I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
Joey : You know, I had a chance to stop her too!

Ross: Yeah?
Joey: Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose.  Wait a minute...
Chandler: Yes, Joe?

Joey: I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
Phoebe : You doing ok?
Rachel: Well, I've been better.
Phoebe: Uh-hmm.

Monica: Joey's bare ass!
Chandler: . Well played.
Rachel: I love you Phoebe.
Phoebe: I love you too.  Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch! 

Rachel: Can you come here with me for a minute?
Monica: Sure.
Phoebe:  Are you wearing waterproof mascara?

Monica: No.
Phoebe: Oh, you're so screwed. 
Ross:  Hey. What was that all about?

Ross: Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her. 
Joey: I really made you think about that thing uh?
Chandler:  Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you. 
Rachel:  Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.

Chandler: I think these are yours.
Phoebe: These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
Rachel:  Can I talk to you alone for a minute?

Monica:  So, I guess you're next. You're ready?
Ross: I don't think so. 
Chandler: Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.

Monica: You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
Chandler: That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic. 
Ross: God! I can't believe she saved me for last.  Why are they taking so long? 
Phoebe: I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
All: No, no, no, no!

Ross: No, I don't think so.
Phoebe: You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
Monica: Yeah. Mine too.
Chandler: Mine was a humdinger 

Ross:  O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?  NOT FROM YOU! 
Phoebe: Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
Monica: And say what? "You owe me a goodbye",

Monica: I hope Ross isn't too upset.
Joey: I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
Phoebe: Tell me about it.
Chandler: Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.

Phoebe: I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
Monica: We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
Chandler: Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
Joey: Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea. 

Monica: Oh my God! Let me see. 
Joey: Who's that dirty old lady?
Chandler: Monica's grandmother.

Monica: Nana liked it rough!
Erica: Hi!
All: Hey!
Joey: Come on here, have a seat.
Phoebe: How was your night?

Erica: Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
Monica: Oh my God!
Chandler: Relax! We just get her some antacids.

Monica: She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.
Chandler: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.

Monica: All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh! 
Chandler: Honey, it's gonna be okay.
Erica: You can do this. Just breathe.

Monica: Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.
Joey: Chandler, wait, wait, wait...
Chandler: What?

Jennifer Aniston : Previously on Friends.
Monica: Erica, are you okay?
Erica: Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach-aches. They come and go like every few minutes.

Phoebe: Guess what? You're almost an uncle!
Ross: What?
Joey: Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!

Ross: Shhh!
Phoebe:  Yay!
Joey: So, so is she still going to Paris?

Ross: Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
Phoebe: Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical!  "Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes..."
Rachel: Morning!

Phoebe: Guess we'll never know how it ends.
Joey: Okay.
Ross: Hey.
Rachel: Hey.

Ross: Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
Joey: Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
Rachel: Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...
Phoebe:  Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.

Monica: It's just a little bit more, honey.
Erica: Help me! This hurts!
Chandler: Is it really that bad?

Erica: Uh-huh! I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse!
Doctor: The baby's head is crowning.
Monica: Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!
Chandler: I'm okay.

Monica: Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!
Chandler: Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
Doctor: Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders...

Monica: It's a... It's a boy!
Chandler: Wow!
Erica: Is he okay?
Doctor: He's just fine.

Monica: Oh, you did it!
Chandler:  It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
Doctor: Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?

Chandler: Okay.
Monica:  Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.
Erica: I'm really happy for you guys.

Chandler: How do you feel?
Erica: I'm tired!
Doctor: Well, you don't have that much time to relax. The other one will be along in a minute.
Monica: I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?

Doctor: I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.
Chandler: Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
Monica:  Wait, did you know it was twins?

Doctor: Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.
Monica:  Anybody tell you?
Erica: I don't think so. Although, they did mention something about two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well, that's good 'cause I'm having a baby.

Monica: This is unbelievable.
Erica: Twins actually run in my family.
Chandler: Interesting!  Can I see you for a second?

Ross: What?
Joey: Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
Phoebe: Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.

Ross: You really think so?
Phoebe: I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song.  "Bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away. Bam-bam-bam-bam..."
Rachel: Hi!

Phoebe: Can't a girl finish a song around here?
Joey: Hey!
Rachel: Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
Ross: Okay.

Joey: Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
Rachel: No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
Phoebe: Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.

Rachel: Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!
Ross: Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
Joey: Ross, wait!

Ross: What? What?
Joey: Could you get me a muffin?
Gunther: Rachel?
Rachel: Yeah?

Rachel: Oh... Bye guys.
Ross: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Unbelievable!
Joey: Hey, you know what might help?

Monica: Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
Chandler: Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
Nurse: We're going to take Erica to recovery now.

Monica: Okay, well, bye!
Erica: Bye!
Chandler: Bye!

Monica: We'll call you!
Erica: Okay.
Chandler: Have fun at church-camp!

Phoebe: How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?
Joey: No, I sat in the paint.
Ross: Hey.

Phoebe: What?
Joey: Why not?
Ross: Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.

Phoebe: How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.
Ross: Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
Joey: Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...

Phoebe: Uh, Joe?
Joey: Damn it!
Ross: Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.

Phoebe: Hey! What do you have there?
Mike: Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but..
Ross: Oh my God! You did that yourself?

Phoebe: Honey, that's gorgeous!
Joey: You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
Rachel: Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!

Joey: Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise.
Phoebe: Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.
Rachel: Oh my God!
Ross: Oh my God!

Rachel: Hi! Oh my gosh!
Chandler: Hey.
Phoebe, Ross, Rachel: Hey.
Joey:  Hey, so what is the big surprise?

Rachel: What... What...
Ross: Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?
Monica: Yes, it's twins!

Ross: Oh my God.
Joey: Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?
Monica:  This is a boy,  and that's a girl.
Chandler: Her name is Erica.
Rachel: Aw..

Joey: Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
Chandler: Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
Monica: Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
Ross: Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
Phoebe: Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"
Rachel: Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.
Mike:  I want one.

Phoebe: Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.
Rachel: Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.
Monica: I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.

Rachel: Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much.
Monica: I love you.
Chandler: I love you.

Rachel: Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there.
Phoebe: So, you just let her go?
Ross: Yeah.
Joey: Hey, maybe that's for the best.

Ross: Yeah?
Joey: Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
Phoebe: But now she'll never know how he feels!

Phoebe: Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!
Ross: My coat...
Joey: This is so cool!
Chandler: I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!

Joey: But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say?
Ross: I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!
Phoebe: You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport.

Ross: Hey!
Man: 18th and East End.
Phoebe: I - I don't take passengers.

Joey: Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
Chandler: Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Monica: Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.

Joey: Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!
Chandler: Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
Monica: Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.

Chandler: Alright.
Monica: Oh God! What did I just step on?
Joey: Oh!

Chandler: It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
Monica: Oh..
Joey: You stepped on my egg roll?

Monica: I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
Joey: Just put it on a plate and leave.
Chandler: Okay, let's find these birds.

Ross: Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.
Phoebe: We're on our honeymoon.
Ticket agent: And the destination?

Ross: No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.
Phoebe: Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.
Monica: Hello.

Phoebe: Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.
Ross: What? Hey, hey, listen..
Monica: Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.

Joey: Okay, here we go. I can't do it.
Chandler: Well, I can't do it either.
Monica: Hey! Did you find them?

Ross: I am not doing this over the phone.
Phoebe: You don't have any other choice!
Rachel: Hello?

Rachel: Wait, what are you doing?
Passenger 1: Well, I can't take this plane now.
Air stewardess: Excuse me, sir, where are you going?

Passenger 1: I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a feeling something's wrong with the left Philange.
Rachel: Could I get some peanuts?
Passenger 2: What's wrong with the plane?
Air stewardess: There's nothing wrong with the plane.

Passenger 1: Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a Philange!
Passenger 2: I'm not flying on it!
Air stewardess: Ma'am, please sit down!
Passenger 3: What's going on?

Monica: Alright. My job here is done.
Chandler: That was... Impressive.
Joey: Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!

Monica: Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.
Chandler: Sorry about the table, man.
Joey: Yeah.

Gate attendant 2: Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.
Ross: Where is she?
Phoebe: I don't see her.

Ross: No, no, no, but...
Phoebe:  RACHEL!!
Rachel: Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?

Phoebe: Okay, you're on.
Rachel: What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?
Ross: Okay, the thing is..

Rachel: Oh my God.
Ross: I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm.. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane.
Gate attendant 2: Miss? Are you boarding the plane?

Ross: Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do.
Gate attendant 2: Miss?
Rachel: I - I have to get on the plane.

Joey: So did you guys make it in time?
Phoebe: Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.
Chandler: Where's Ross?

Rachel:  I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.
Air stewardess:  Miss, I can't let you off the plane.
Ross: Let her off the plane!

Air stewardess:  I am afraid you are gonna have to take a seat.
Rachel:  Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!
Ross: Try to understand!
