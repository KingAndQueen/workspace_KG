Joey:  We're not peeking? 

Joey: Yeah uh look Rach, there's something I gotta tell ya.
Rachel: Hey!
Nurse: Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?

Rachel: Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won't take my breast?
Nurse: It's all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but don't worry. It'll happen.
Joey:  Yowsa! 

Rachel: Oh look, she's pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?  She looks scared. Doesn't she look scared?
Joey: Y'know, I don't really know her.
Nurse: Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow. 

Chandler: This is okay. We're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. 
Monica: Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
Mr. Geller: Of course. I'll always be your dad.

Chandler:  Why? Why-why-would youWh-why -  Look, I just don't want you to think that we're animals who do it whenever we want.
Mr. Geller: Oh, I don't think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.
Monica: The truth is, Dad, we're-we're trying.

Ross: Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?
Joey: No.
Rachel: Yes you did!

Ross: Whoa! You were down on one knee?

Joey: Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn't - I didn't propose!
Ross: Then what did happen?
Rachel: Yeah, what did happen?

Joey: It wasn't my ring! It's Ross's ring! That's why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.
Ross: What?!
Rachel: You were gonna propose to me?

Ross: No, you didn't!
Joey: Oh that's right. There's a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
Nurse: Hey, she just woke up! She's hungry. Why don't we give this another try?
Rachel: Okay.

Ross: Hey, I'm not going to rush into anything!
Joey: Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!
Rachel: Oh my God!

Ross: What?
Rachel: She's doing it Look, she's breast-feeding look!
Joey:  Ah, it's beautiful.
Nurse: I'll come back for her later.

Mike: I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will.
Phoebe: Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...

Ross: You even have to ask?!    He is alive!
SCENE: Restaurant
Phoebe: You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.

Mike: No, I didn't.

Joey: Please, we're trying to have a conversation. 
Mary Ellen: Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'.

Mike: What?!
Joey: What?!
Phoebe: Do you not know each other?

Joey:  Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games.  Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!
Phoebe: Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?
Mike:  Six!

Joey: Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.
Mike: I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his mother with a car.
Phoebe:  You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.

Monica: That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
Ross: Hey!

Monica: How was the pediatrician?
Rachel: Oh, I really liked him.  Yeah, it was really, really, really good.
Ross: You promised you wouldn't say anything.

Rachel: I know.  Ross still sees his pediatrician!!!  I don't care!
Monica: Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
Ross: He's a brilliant diagnostician!
Chandler: Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?

Rachel: Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.
Ross: Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'
Chandler: Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?

Ross: It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!
SCENE: Central Perk
Mike: Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can we talk?

Gunther: Ha!

Joey:  Seriously Gunther, you should see someone about that cold. If it gets much worse you could DIE!

Phoebe: ...and I said Vicrum, you can't just call every time you get lonely, you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel. 
Mike: But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross.

Phoebe: I guess so, can I, can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers? 
Mike: Definitely
Ross:  This is Vicrum. 
SCENE: Chandler  Monica' s Place 
Chandler: Hi honey I'm home!
Monica: Hi, how was your flight? 

Chandler: You are an amazing wife. No really, you're amazing! You were actually gonna do this for me, I mean, where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that? 
Monica: I'm very, very drunk right now. 
SCENE: Central Perk 
Joey:  See, ordinarily I would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken... did I sleep with her? did I not sleep with her?
Phoebe: You know, maybe this is a wake-up call, about your whole dating attitude. You're in your 30's and you've never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long-term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience, never even worrying that it doesn't turn into anything serious. 

Joey: You're right! I love my life!  I actually did sleep with her. 
SCENE: Central Perk.
Phoebe: Oh hey you guys, I couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.

Joey: So spooky, that's all.
Ross: So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?
Phoebe: No! It's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Ugh, I get mad at him, but I think it's a little to soon to show my true colors.
Rachel: Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma.  Which one of us should go to dinner?

Phoebe: Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That's fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven't been together, the six of us, in such a long time.
Monica: What are you talking about? We're all together right now.
Rachel: Um, Mon, Chandler's not here.

Monica: Oh, dear God!
SCENE: Tulsa, a conference room
Chandler: Good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? Yes, Ken is it?
Ken: That's right. Is it true the reason you're here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?

Chandler: I always liked you, Ken. 
SCENE: Moncia and Chandler's.
Phoebe:  Trick or treat!
Monica:  Hey!

Phoebe:  I'm gonna go.
Chandler:  Okay, something to cover the smell ... Oven cleaner!  Unscented!
Monica:  Welcome home. I've missed you. Join me in the bedroom?

Chandler: But, those are for you.
SCENE: Ross and Rachel's.
Ross:  Alright, we'll just, uh, see you when you get here. Bye.  Huh, that was my mom, she's stuck in terrible traffic.
Rachel: Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.

Ross: Oh,  Holy moly, are we in a pickle now.
SCENE: The restaurant. Phoebe and Joey are sitting alone at a table for six.
Phoebe: Where is everyone? They're forty minutes late.
Joey: I know.

Phoebe: I'm starving. I knew we were coming here tonight, so I ate nothing all day.
Joey: What about me, huh? Only had one lunch today.
Waiter: So, are we expecting the rest of our party shortly?

Phoebe:  Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing.
Waiter: Right. We do have a table for two available, perhaps you would be more comfortable.
Joey: No, they're coming, we're waiting right here.

Phoebe: One really does have a stick up one's ass, doesn't one.
SCENE: Chandler and Monica's
Monica: How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad where the little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling.
Chandler: I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.

Monica: Oh good, I hate it when you do that
Chandler: And lots of kissing your neck!
SCENE: Outside Ross and Rachel's.
Ross: Okay, well the superintendant is not home.
Rachel: No!

Ross: A pigeon, a pigeon. No, no wait, no, no, an eagle flew in! Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby in its talons. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still ablaze are locked in a death grip, swirling around in the whirl pool that fills the apartment.
Rachel: Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true.
SCENE: The restaurant, still only Phoebe and Joey.
Waiter: Hello.
Phoebe  Joey: Hey.

Waiter: Strange man.
Joey: But it happens?  I'm gotta go to the bathroom.
Phoebe: No, you can't go. No-no-no, I can't hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I'll cave.

Joey: If you ask me to stay, I'll pee. 
Maitre D': Good evening, Miss.  Miss?  Miss? Miss!
Phoebe: Okay, fine, I'll move. Alright, you don't have to manhandle me.  Where? Okay. Thank you. .

Joey:  Finally you guys made it.  Pheebs, who the hell...ahhh!
SCENE: The Bings' bedroom.
Monica: Spend more time with the tie. That'll make a baby.
Chandler: Look, I can't do this. I can't make love to you while we're fighting this way.

Monica: Okay.
SCENE: Ross  Rachel's 
Rachel:  Oh, God, Oh, thank god, you're okay. I'm so sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. 
Ross: Great. So let's get going?

Rachel: Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I'm never leaving her again.
Ross's Mom: I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his willie between his legs and cried out: "Mommy, I'm a girl, take me with you."
Ross: Somehow, over time, it got easier to be apart from you.
SCENE: Monica and Chandler's, in bed
Chandler: Uhh. You are welcome.
Monica: You know what? Let's not talk.

Chandler: I feel so used.
SCENE: Restaurant
Phoebe: Well, I guess they're not coming. You wanna just order?
Joey: Thank you. Waiter! All right, this is gonna be fast, so try to keep up. Risotto with the shaped truffels and the roasted rip steak with the golden ??? and a Bordelaise sauce, unless any of that stuff I just said means snails.
Waiter: It doesn't.

Phoebe: Both it is, thank you.
Joey: Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request? Can you bring everything as soon as it's ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don't care.
Ross  Rachel:  Hey, hi, hi!
Waiter: I'll just wait to put your order in.

Phoebe: You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?
Ross: I'm so sorry ...
Rachel: We got locked out of the apartment, we ...
Joey: That's a great story. Can I eat it?

Ross: And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.
Rachel: It wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got to do.
Phoebe: And that's Judy over there at the bar with Emma?

Rachel: Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?
Joey:  Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
Ross: Y'know this ??? is incredible.

Joey:  Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
Ross: Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck.
Rachel: Yeah, I'll have the soup and the salmon.

Joey: Son of a bitch!
Phoebe: Where, where have you been?
Monica: Well, we had a little fight.
Chandler: I would never lie to get someone into bed.

Monica: You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn't it? How come you didn't get a bigger table? ...You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica.  I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.
Chandler: I suppose that Monica will have the ... manipulative shrew.
Waiter:  I'll give you another minute.
Joey: Why are you going?  He said she wanted the shrew! 
Ross: Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine. You're turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.
Rachel: You guys ever heard the story about when Ross's mom went to the beauty salon?

Chandler: You mean the willie story?
Ross: Huh-huh, they already know it!  
Phoebe: You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.
Joey:  No, no, it's okay, I already told the waiter what they want.
Monica: Why would you do that?

Joey: Chandler, control your woman!
Rachel:  Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast ... to Phoebe. She dropped her sock.
Phoebe: Aw ... what?

Rachel:  Could you please get her attention?
Ross: Mommy!
Phoebe:  Oh, for god's sake,  Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock!  I'm sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt the hideousness that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call.  Well, it's too late now.

Ross: Well, I don't think that's us.
Phoebe: Well, this is, this is, this is not over!  Hello?
Joey:  Well, what is going on with you two?
Monica: Um, you see, I'm ovulating.
Chandler: Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed.

Monica: Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough.
Chandler:  You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.
Joey: So? You had sex, right?

Chandler: What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl?
Phoebe:  Okay, that was Mike.
Rachel: Phoebe, hi, we're so sorry. You're totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.

Phoebe: Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I'm not the kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys!  Judy! Bye.
Rachel: Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home?
Ross: You know, I think that's a good idea. Our babysitter just pounded down another Chardonnay. Bye, you guys.
Monica: Bye.
Joey: See ya. Well, this is just us.
Monica  Chandler: Mhum.

Monica: So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?
Chandler: So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?
Joey: Do, you gonna go do it now?

Monica: We don't have much time. Once the egg decends into the ovaries ..
Joey: No, no .
Waiter: I sincerely hope the rest of your party is returning.

Joey: Nah, just me. All alone.  Dinner for six for one, huh.  You boys are about to see something really special.
SCENE: continues, Joey finished everything
Waiter: How was everything, sir?

Joey: Excellent. The shrew in particular was exquisite .
Waiter: Well, I hope you've got some room left.
Waiters:  Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear ...

Mike: You need both hands for that?
Phoebe: Yeah, I kinda do.  Well, how's this? 
Joey:  Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious?  Have you not talked about it yet?  Am I making you uncomfortable?  If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh 

Rachel: Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
Nanny Candidate: Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question.  Do you guys do random drug testing?
Ross: Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.

Nanny Candidate: That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm gonna need three days notice.
Rachel: Okidoki!  Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
Ross: Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews  And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.

Sandy: I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart... 
Rachel: Sandy, that's exactly what it is...
Ross: Are you gay? 

Rachel: Oh, that's pretty.
Ross:  So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
Sandy: I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child.

Ross: Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. 
Rachel: Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
Sandy: Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...

Rachel:  Yes?
Ross: King?
Sandy: I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. Plus... it keeps the hands young... 

Rachel: I can't... I can't hear it again.
Sandy: You know, I can't tell it again... 
Ross: And I'm fine never having heard it...  Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?

Phoebe: Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...
David: Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul... ui... 
Mike: Well... hey, the key works...! 

Ross: ...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
Monica: Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
Joey: Uhm... A penis model.  Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?

Monica: Yeah, so?
Ross: Wow!
Joey: Really? Do you not know Chandler?

Monica: Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
Joey: So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is... 
Ross: Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?

Joey: Heeeyy! Hey!
Chandler: What are you guys talking about?
Ross: Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. 

Chandler: I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
Monica: Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...?  That slayed me.
Ross: Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! 
Joey: Not knowing when to shut up...

Mike: Your lipstick's on his mouth.
David: Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.
Phoebe: No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.

Mike: ...kiss him?
Phoebe: Oh, well, yeah...
David: Yes, but uhm... You should know... she really likes you. I-In fact I-I-I don't think you realise j-just how lucky you are fella. 

Mike: Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about it... 
Phoebe: Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt!  Here David, you should just go.
David: All right... But... if I ever do come back from Minsk...  well, you just better watch out.

Mike: Well, I might.
David: Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just lovely there.
Phoebe: Okay, well... guys?

David: Right-o, right-o...  Take good care of her. 
Phoebe: I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand.
Mike: It's never gonna happen again right?

Joey: Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this... 
Ross:  I swear to God...! 
Sandy: Who's up for puppets?

Joey: Me! I'm up for puppets!
Sandy: Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus?
Ross: Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?

Sandy: Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us. 
Joey: I wanna be Mr. Wigglemunch. 
Ross:  Oh my God!

Ross: I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
Sandy: Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.
Rachel:  Oh, damn you Geller!

SandyGrumpus: A friend-ship...
Joey: Wow! You blow my mind...
Sandy: Oh, I gotta go.

Joey: It's like the cheapest college ever.
SCENE: 
Ross: And that's why, no matter what mommy says, we really were on a break.  Yes we were! Yes we were!  Come here gorgeous.  Oh! Look at you! You are the cutest little baby ever! You're just a... a little bitty baby, you know that? But you've got...  You've got big beautiful eyes... Yes you do... and a... and a big round belly.  Big baby butt! I like big butts.  I like big butts and I cannot lie  you other brothers can't deny  when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist  and a round thing in your face you get... Oh my God, Emma... you're laughing! Oh my God, you've never done that before, have you? You never done that before... Daddy made you laugh, huh? Well, daddy and Sir Mix Alot... What? What? You... you wanna hear some more? Uhm... My anaconda don't want none  unless you got buns hon...  I'm a terrible father!

SCENE: 
Chandler: Hi!
Joey: Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?

Chandler: How come?
Joey: Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it.
Monica: What do you do with your money now?

Joey: Real estate, huh? Hmmm...
Monica: Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!
Chandler: Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!

Monica: My dad told me. They play golf together.
Chandler: Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.
SCENE: 
Phoebe: Hi!
Rachel and Monica: Hey!

Phoebe: Okay, so... all right... Which dress?  You can say "neither".
Rachel and Monica: Oh God, neither!
Monica: I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine.
Rachel: Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like: "Oh Mr. Pincer, I can see where Wallis gets his good looks..."

Monica: I knew you didn't get a 1400!
Rachel: Sssh yeah, well, duh! I mean...
Phoebe: So... now... What about with Mike's mom?

Rachel: Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had.
Monica: She said WHAT?
Phoebe: That's she's like the daughter she never had.  Listen! 
SCENE: 

Rachel: owwwww...
Ross: Please don't take her away from me!
SCENE: 
Catherine: Oh hi, come on in. I'm Catherine, the listing agent.
Joey: Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
Chandler: So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?

Catherine: Actually, he is buying a much bigger place. It's got a great view of Central Pa....
Chandler: Mmm That's enough about you!
Joey: Is there anything we should know about the apartment?

Catherine: Oh... Okay, sorry!
Joey: Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?
Chandler: We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man!  You don't think he's here, do you? 

Joey: Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape...  Wait a minute... This says Monica...  And this is Richard's apartment... 
Chandler: Get there faster! 
SCENE: 
Mike: Wow! You look like... like my mom.
Phoebe: I'm wearing pantyhose!

Mike: Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents: Theodore and Bitsy.
Phoebe: Theodore... Bitsy... What a delight!
Bitsy: It's so nice to finally meet you!

Phoebe: Got it! It... It's hard to stop...
Mike: Well, come on...
Theodore: Phoebe, these are our friends, Tom and Sue Angle.
Bitsy: Phoebe, come sit. Tell us a little bit about yourself... So where are you from?

Phoebe: I really, really am sorry.
Theodore: How could you know. Why wouldn't you punch me in the stomach? 
Mike: Uhm... Did you just hit my dad?

Phoebe: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way. No, no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...
Bitsy: That's... my boy. 
Mike: Awesome!
SCENE: 
Chandler: I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching?  Well, we know I'm gonna watch it. 
Joey: Hey dude, what's up?

Chandler: It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer...  What the...  What are you doing?
Joey: You don't wanna see what I just saw! 
Monica: What are you guys doing?  Oh my God, is that Richard? 
SCENE: 
Rachel: Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for mommy...  Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap...  My name is mommy and I'm here to say  that all the babies are... Oh, I can't rap... All right sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I know that you're not gonna tell anybody...  I like... big butts and I cannot lie...  You other brothers can't deny...  when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face...  Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh!  I like big butts and I cannot lie...  You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing! Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. Oh you beautiful little weirdo... 
Ross: Hey!

Rachel: Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...
SCENE: 
Phoebe: ...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly cat, Sme-lly ca-t  I-t's not your fau-lt. And that's the end of the song... I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes.
Mike: Phoebe writes lots of great songs. Wha... What was that one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?

Phoebe: Oh God! Is that veal?
Mike: Mom, I thought I told you... Phoebe's a vegetarian.
Bitsy: Oh!

Phoebe: No, no, no, I actually it's any baby animals: kittens, fish babies... You know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat running through it...  Hmmm... yummy  Hmmm... 
Mike: So...? What do you think? 
SCENE: 
Monica: So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
Chandler: Whoho ho... Listen to the judgment from the porn star!

Monica: I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape, Doctor!
SCENE: 
Theodore: I can't imagine what he sees in her.
Bitsy: She actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife of his.  Oh, hello dear...
Mike: Hey, what's going on?

Bitsy: By the way, do you know who's moving back into town? Tom and Sue's daughter Jen.
Theodore: You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well-behaved and... single.
Mike: I'm not interested.

Bitsy: The woman you what? 
Phoebe: Yeah... The woman you what?
Mike: The woman I love...  I love you... Which is probably something I shouldn't say for the first time in front of my parents... and Tom and Sue...Who are by the way the most sinfully boring I've ever met in my life...

Phoebe: I had a great time.  It was really top drawer. And here's something rich: thirteen bathrooms in this place... I threw up in the coat closet... Ta taaa...
SCENE: 
Ross: She sweat, wet, got it going like a turbo 'vette.
Rachel: So fellas

Ross: Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!
Monica: Hey hon, could you help me get the plates down? 
Chandler: Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today? 

Monica: Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the Queen. 
Joey: Wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap! 
TV announcer: Next up is a marching band from Muskogee, Oaklahoma. 
Chandler: Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo-hoo! 

TV announcer: And heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives . 
Joey: Oh my God! 
Chandler: Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives? 

Joey: I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said "Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani." Like... like I was some kind of idiot. 
Chandler: Well you proved them wrong. 
Joey nods: Yeah. 
Rachel to Emma: Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies. 
Ross: A lot of people are thankful for those. 
Woman at door: Hello? Rachel? 
Rachel: Who is it? 

Woman at door: It's your favorite sister. 
Ross and Rachel while looking at each other surprised and shocked: Jill? 
Woman at door in a sing song voice: Amy. 
Rachel: Hide my rings. 

Amy: Its a girl? 
Ross: Hey Amy. 
Rachel: Oh Amy, you remember Ross. 

Amy: No, I'm not talking about you.  It was your fat friends brother with that bad afro, do you remember? 
Ross starts talking over her 'do you remember' line: Amy. I'm going to save you some time, ok.  All me. 
Monica: Careful.  Careful. CAREFUL! 
Chandler: I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise.  hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out... 

Monica: well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me. 
Chandler: Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine? 
Phoebe: Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving! 
Joey: Hey happy Thanksgiving... Pheebs! 

Phoebe: "Pick up grandma at the airport"? 
Joey: Oh... man... 
Amy with straight hair: Oh she's precious. Do you ever worry she's going to get your real nose? 
Rachel: Amy!  Yes I do... I really do. 
Amy: Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on one sec.  Can I take this upstairs? 
Ross: Sure, we don't live there but... 

Amy: Ew. 
Rachel: God she is unbelievable. 
Ross: I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD. 

Rachel: What? What happened? 
Amy: My boyfriend canceled on me. I mean... I I finally find a real relationship. I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then his wife comes back into town. I swear, its almost not worth dating married guys. 
Ross: Don't say that. 

Amy: Oh. I was so looking forward to this. It was going to be such a beautiful Thanksgiving. We were going to have sushi. 
Rachel: Oh Amy, don't cry Amy. Um... Ross, could I talk to you in private? 
Ross: Sure, you want to go upstairs? 

Rachel: Ross, you know what? She may need one...We're just going to have to make our peace with that! 
Rachel opens their door: Hi. 
Everyone there says: Hi, hey. 

Rachel: Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy. This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon. 
Everyone: Hi. 
Amy: Oh my god. You're on Days of Our Lives. 
Joey laughs: Yeah. 

Amy: wow. They must put a lot of makeup on you. 
Joey looks rejected: Hap... Hap... Happy Thanksgiving. 
Ross to Monica: Hi. 
Monica to Ross: Hi. 
Monica to Emma : Hey you. 
Monica to Amy: So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're seeing Emma? 
Amy with confused look on face: Yeah I... I think so.  It's nice to meet you Emma. 
Phoebe shakes her hand and says : Phoe-Be. 

Amy: Oh. That's a funny noise. 
Joey: Pheebs, I still need some help here 
Phoebe: Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying. 

Joey: Oh... I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know... I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor. 
Phoebe looks down : You are a terrific actor. 
Amy coming out of the bathroom: Hey. Hey where's the baby? 
Rachel: Oh we just put her down for a nap. 
Amy: Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible? If you guys died. 
Ross first has a look of 'huh' then changes it to sarcastic happy: Thank you Amy. 

Amy: Now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything cause you know you'd be dead. I was thinking about changing her name. I'm just not really a big fan of Emily. 
Transcriber note: I'm surprised that Rachel and Ross didn't say they weren't either here 
Ross: Emma. 
Amy turns around to Phoebe: Emma, Ross wants you. 
Phoebe: PHOE-BE. 
Amy turns to Ross and Rachel: Why does she keep making that noise? 
Rachel: Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself  um you wouldn't get the baby. 

Amy: Well who would? 
Ross: Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler. 
Chandler: I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma. 
Monica: yeah oh my god, I'm so moved. 

Amy: This guy? Seriously? 
Monica: Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china... um and its very expensive so please be careful. 
Ross starts playing with a plate: Woah. Woah...  Woah. 

Monica: No, honey, its. thats a special plate. See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins. 
Joey: I can't believe I won. 
Amy: Its such a slap in the face. I'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me. 
Rachel: Monica is Ross' sister. 

Amy: No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog. 
Rachel: Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that. 
Monica about to have a heart attack: Okay, listen I know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this. 
Monica: Now see, this way you protect the plate... and lets face it you have fun. 

Amy: Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do I get the baby? 
Chandler: No, if crazy plate lad...  If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right? 
Rachel: Well actually... 

Chandler: What? 
Amy: Hurts, doesn't it? 
Joey raises his hand: Uh... who has to die for me to get her? 

Chandler: So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma? 
Ross looks down: No, that that is not what we're saying. 
Joey: Yeah he's lying. He looked down. 

Chandler: Well what is wrong with me? Am I ... am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you! 
Rachel: Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just... you're more the fun parent. 
Ross: Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin... someone who can be firm and strict. 
Monica: Thats not how you see me, is it? 
Phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air: No you're all about the fun. 

Chandler: Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die  she'd have to give her up. 
Ross: Sure, Monica would have to give her up. 
Joey: I lie better then that, right? 

Chandler: So... let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me? 
Phoebe: There's your movie! 
Monica: Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner. 

Chandler: You said that to me last week. 
Monica: How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture. 
Joey groans and gets off the phone : The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me...  And they all got to meet Santa! 
Phoebe: It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency. 
Joey: Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency. 

Phoebe: No! Nothing with a raccoon. 
Joey: Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. 
Monica: Oh wait... What are you doing? 

Joey: Setting the table. 
Phoebe: Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too. 
Monica: Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress. 
Ross: Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before. 
Chandler: Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey. 
Amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to Rachel: Ucch.  Uchh  In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you. 
Rachel: UCHH! 
Amy: You know... this... this is classic Rachel. 

Rachel: I did the first time! Oh. Oh...  And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you. 
Ross: Emma. 
Rachel turns to Ross: Oh whose side are you on?  I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child. 
Amy: How hard could it be? You do it. 
Joey: ooh oooh... 

Amy: You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your new baby and your, your small apartment.  Well let me tell you something. Your baby isn't even that cute. 
Ross walks over: Too far, Amy. Too far. 
Rachel: You take that back. 

Amy: I do yoga. 
Rachel: Bring it on! 
Monica: Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes! 

Rachel: Alright. Thats it! 
Monica screaming at Ross: Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time! 
Rachel starts messing up Amy's hair: Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!! 
Phoebe: Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this? 
Joey: What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them. 

Rachel: Ew! Gross. 
Chandler: Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now. 
Amy: I'm sorry. 

Rachel: Mon, I'm so sorry. 
Chandler: Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it. 
Amy and Rachel at same time: Sorry. 

Chandler: Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose. 
Rachel: Are you okay Mon? 
Monica: uh huh... I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died. 
Phoebe: It's all right. You can mourn. 
Monica starts crying: Thank you. It was so beautiful.  I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies. 
Joey: Actually its not pies, its just pie. 

Monica: I don't care.  Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold. 
Rachel: Look Amy, it got a little of control...Um... and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh... if it really means that much to you... 
Amy: So you're going to give me the baby? 

Phoebe: You gonna tell her? 
Chandler: Nope...  Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time. 
Monica: Like only if the queen comes? 

Chandler: Maybe not even then.  
Joey: Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Pheebs. 
Phoebe: No problem! Next week: stealing...  
Monica: Bye plates! 

Joey: Uhm...  Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came in... 
SCENE:
Jo Lynn: This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies. 
Chandler: Yep. That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn. Single are ya?

Chandler: Yeah, ah, ah.. . I'll think of something. 
SCENE:
Ross: Wow!  Wow, you look.. . uh.. . It's just, ah.. . That dress.. . uh.. . 
Rachel: Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good. 

Ross: I don't know. But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know. He plays piano; I played keyboards in college. He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area. 
Rachel: Yeah. 
Phoebe: Hi

Rachel: Okay. You too. And I hope you score.  Bye. 
Mike: Bye. 
Ross: So.. . Welcome. 

Mike: My cousin's a paleontologist. 
Ross: Ah?  Well, he and I would probably have a lot to talk about. 
SCENE:
Monica: Hi. 
Chandler: Hey. 

Monica: Oh. 
Chandler: See what I mean.. . 
Joey: Hey! How come the door's locked?

Monica: So, you lied to him?
Chandler: Achhh. It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.  Except with you. 
Joey: Hey! Open the door. What's going on? 

Joey: Absolutely. You'd do it for me. Not that you ever have to because I know how to keep my women satisfied. 
SCENE:
Ross: Shouldn't the pizza be here by now? I mean, they said thirty minutes or less. Well, how long has it been?
Mike: Eleven minutes.  And now twelve. So, do you like the beer?

Ross: I don't know. We could look it up. 
Mike: Things are about to get wild. 
SCENE:
Phoebe: Oh God. Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and Ross?
Rachel: Oh God. It seems like forever ago. 

Phoebe: I hope you were using protection. 
Waiter: Excuse me. Um, these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar. 
Rachel: Oh.  Should we send them something back?

Phoebe: Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen. We're just having fun. You know, not everything had to go as far as "eye-contact. "
SCENE:
Monica: Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa. 
Chandler: Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?  I heard it. 

Monica: Scary pigeon's back?
Chandler: It's huge. 
SCENE:

SCENE:
Rachel: Oh my God. I can't believe you live in that building. My grandmother lives in that building. Ida Green? No sense of personal space? Kind of smells like chicken? Looks like a potato. 
Bill: "Spuds" is your grandmother?

Rachel: That's my bubby!
Kevin: So, we're on our way to a couple of parties. Um.. . maybe we can get your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun. 
Phoebe: Yeah.. . I'm sorry. We weren't really looking for anything to happen with you guys. I, I have a boyfriend. 

Kevin: All right. It's no big deal. 
Bill: So, she has a boyfriend. What is your situation?
Rachel: Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend. But um.. . 

Bill: Okay. 
Rachel: Oh sure. 
Phoebe: Oh my God, you're giving your real number. 

Bill: Bye
Phoebe: Bye.  Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?
Rachel: I don't know. He was cute, and he liked me. It was an impulse. 

Rachel: Oh God, Ross. Ross is going to pick up the phone. Oh, I have to get my number back.  Oh my God. He's gone. 
Phoebe: "Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone. "  Dead on. 
SCENE:
Mike: Ya know, I'm going to take off. 
Ross: So soon?

Mike: I can't do that!
Phoebe: He says he can't do that. 
Rachel: Oh give me , , ,  Hi, Mike? Hi. Listen. I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what? If you do this I.. . Phoebe will.. . do anything you want. Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff. 

Phoebe: Oh, Mike. Bye. 
Mike: Hey buddy. 
Ross: Uh, hi. 

Mike: I, I was just thinking about how much more we have to talk about. 
Ross: But you left. 
SCENE:
Joey: Wow! That didn't take long. I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight. 
Chandler: Well, you're forgetting about the time difference. 
Monica: Chandler! You're home!

Chandler: Joey said that you're in here with another man. 
Monica: There's no man in here. How dare you accuse me of that. 
Joey: All right. All right. Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh?  Bwa-ah-ah!

Chandler: What is he doing?
Monica: I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy. 
Joey: Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows. 

Chandler: All right. Well, I'll check the guest room. 
Joey: Why do I smell men's cologne?
Monica: I think that's you. 

Joey: Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?
Chandler: I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?
SCENE:
Mike: So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the same thing. Fascinating isn't it. 
Ross: Maybe you should look up "fascinating. "

Mike: I'll get it.  Hello? Ross's place. Mike speaking.  It's for you. 
Ross: I don't understand what just happened here. 
SCENE:
Joey: What's going on?
Chandler: I'm sorry. I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know.. . I didn't think you'd understand. 

Joey: Yeah? 
Monica: I don't know what to say. We shouldn't have lied to you. 
Chandler: Yeah. I feel so bad. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?

Joey: All right. 
Monica: You can go. 
Chandler: What?

Monica: Have fun. 
Joey: Thanks.  Here's your ticket. 
Chandler: Hey, listen. I'm never going to lie to you again, okay? And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid. 

Joey: Where are you going?
Chandler: Game's tomorrow night Joe. 
SCENE:
Rachel: Hi. 
Ross: Oh God. 

Rachel: Oh.. . 
Mike: I'm so glad you're back. 
Phoebe: Oh. 

Rachel: Wow. So, what did you guys do?
Ross: Oh, you know.. . we just drank some beer and Mike played with the boundaries of normal social conduct. 
Mike: It's true. I did. 
Phoebe: Well, good bye. 

Rachel: Yeah?
Ross: Never mind. 
SCENE:

Ross: Hey you guys. 
Mike: Hey. 
Phoebe: Hey. I'll be right back. I've got to go to the bathroom. 

Mike: Stout. That's a kind of beer. 
SCENE:
Phoebe: ...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;
Joey: Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?

Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Chandler: Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.
Monica: I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
Ross: You're really not coming back?

Chandler: So, who does?
Phoebe: Oh, I like my job.
Joey: I love my job.
Rachel: Yeah, I can't wait to go back to work.
Ross: I can't get enough dinosaurs!

Chandler: All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's no call  for writing "Screw you, Mr. Bing!" on the back of my chair!  -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.
Wendy: Hey!
Others: Hey.

Chandler: Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...

SCENE:
Rachel: Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Chandler: I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
Phoebe: Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.

Rachel: We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Chandler: What? That's terrible!
Phoebe: No-no, we do it every year!

Chandler: Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
Phoebe: No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx.
Rachel: Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?

Chandler: No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Phoebe: Oh, that's it?  A great idea! Oh yeah.
Rachel: Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?

Chandler: If I help, we can find 'em faster!
Rachel: That's right!
Phoebe: Ooh ooh, we have a live one!

Rachel: "Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S.: Chandler, I knew they'd break you."

SCENE:
Joey: Rach, these are for you.

Rachel: Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Joey: No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
Chandler: OK, Pheebs, your turn.
Phoebe: Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?

Joey: And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
Ross: You got me a cola drink?
Chandler: And, a lemon lime.

Ross: Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
Chandler: And last but not least.
Joey: They're ribbed for your pleasure.

SCENE:

Ross: Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Chandler: Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Ben: Santa! 

Chandler: What?
Monica: Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.
Ross: What are you doing?

Monica: Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
Others: Merry Christmas! 
Phoebe: Ble-blah-blar Blargh!

Phoebe: Blah blargah, blar-blab.
SCENE:

SCENE:
Chandler: Whoa-ho, back off, Missy! 
Wendy: ...Missy?

Chandler: Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.
Wendy: Okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?

Chandler: Okay, one thing at a time. 
back to 702: The One With Rachel's Book
SCENE:
Monica: Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.

Chandler: I love you so much.
Monica: I love you. 
SCENE:
Rachel: Oohh, I love it!
Ross: Really? You're not gonna return it?

Rachel: Oh wow, it's so beautiful...
Ross: Wow, it really is!
Monica: "Wendy" is a fat girl name.
Phoebe: Aren't we done with that?

Monica: Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?
Chandler: Hey!
Ross: Oh my god...
Joey: Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!

Monica: What are you doing here?
Chandler: I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
Joey: Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?

Chandler: Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
Monica: What?
Ross: What, you, you really quit your job?

Phoebe: Thank you.
Chandler: Here, pass these, will ya.. 
Ross: Oh, hey...

Ross: "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet." -- How did you know?
Rachel: Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
Chandler: I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.
Joey: Mine's is to Lilian Myers.

Joey: No it is awesome! 
Ross: Hi guys. 
All: Hello. 
Phoebe: Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up? 

Ross: Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute? 
Joey: She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head? 
Rachel: Well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna! 

Rachel: I'm the hell person whose office this is! 
Ross: Good one, Raych. 
Guy: I'm Gavin Mitchell, the person who's taken over your job. 

Phoebe: Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous. 
Joey: Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back. 
Director: Okay, okay, okay!  You. Here, come here, here. You're gonna take this tray, you're gonna stay on this yellow mark. You're gonna move on "action!" You're gonna walk over to the operating table. You're gonna stop on that blue mark, you're gonna put the tray down. Don't walk too fast! But don't doddle. 

Joey: Okay. 
Director: Okay, let's try this one more time. 
Phoebe: Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming! 

Chandler: Yeah. 
Ross: Good-bye. 
Monica: Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing.  Didn't see you there Geller. 

Chandler: Yeah, Ross is here so... 
Ross: Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing? 
Monica: We're gonna have sex. 

Ross: You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine. 
Chandler: Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits. 
Monica: Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees. 

Ross: Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan! 
Monica: Sorry.  But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night. 
Chandler: Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant. 

Phoebe: And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky. 
Director: Okay, okay, from the top. And...Action! 
Man: So, I'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me. 
JoeyDrake: I'm surprised to, but yet here I am. 

Gavin: How do you fix the chair? 
Rachel: Except that!  Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon. 
Mr. Zelner: Good, because it's in ten minutes. 

Chandler: I tried, but apparently singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.
Ross: Hey you guys!
Joey and Chandler: Hey! Happy birthday ...
Rachel: Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.

Ross: Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly, Chandler, Joey.
Joey and Chandler: Hi.
Molly: Hi.

Ross: Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.
Joey: You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.
Rachel: Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.
Molly: No, you stay, I'll do it . 

Rachel: OK, thank you.
Molly: Nice to meet you guys .
Joey: Yeah, you too.

Rachel: Oh, wow, Molly is just great!
Ross: Yeah.
Chandler: Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.

Joey: Sure.
Monica: Would you stop staring at her?
Chandler: I wasn't staring. I was leering.

Monica: What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
Ross: Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.
Chandler: Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.

Monica: Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.
Molly: I'm gonna take her back to the apartment.
Ross: Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou ...

Molly: I think it's sweet. 
Ross, Joey and Chandler: Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.
Rachel: Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.
Joey: Why not?

Rachel: Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.
Joey: So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable?  Yeah, sounds about right.
Ross: Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.

Gavin: Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago.  Man, I really bug you, don't I?
Rachel: Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you "momma's boy", starting right now.
Monica: Hey Rach!

Rachel: Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleague and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle. 
Gavin: Pleased to meet you.
Monica: Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?

Rachel: Oh, ok, thank you.  Do you see what all the guys see in her?
Monica: Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me! 
Joey: Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?

Rachel: Yeah, sure!
Joey: Oh ...  Happy birth ...  oh, see you later 
Monica: Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!

Rachel: Oh, give me! 
Phoebe: Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!
Mike: Yeah. We have rat babies now.

Rachel: Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?
Monica: So this is what a stroke feels like.
Phoebe: I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.

Rachel: whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
Phoebe: Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help. 
Ross: Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
Chandler: I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.

Joey: Molly ... people don't study acting ...
Ross: Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
Molly: Sure, I'll go check on Emma.

Ross: What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
Joey: No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real?  Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.
Ross and Chandler: Come on! Joe!

Joey: Ok 
Woman: Hi, is Molly here?
Ross: Yeah, come on in. Molly?
Molly: Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha .  I'll see you tomorrow.

Monica: Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up .
Rachel: Mmm hmm.
Gavin: Yeah, hey. 

Monica: Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.
Rachel: No.
Gavin: Nice party.

Rachel: Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at  ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ...
Monica: Again, you're welcome.
Gavin: Look, I'll just give you this and go.

Rachel: See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ...  and you do that ... 
Chandler: First I was afraid, I was petrified 
Phoebe: Hey

Joey: On...?
Phoebe: On how far along he's in the sex change process!
Monica: No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to, your eyebrows are...

Joey: Arghhh! Double standards!
Phoebe: Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?
Monica: Only if I don't have to get up and sing.

Phoebe: While drinking...
Monica: I'm there!
Rachel: Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.

Phoebe: Oh my god.
Monica: You kissed him?
Rachel: Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...

Salon girl: Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you.
Joey: OK Thanks. . I touched the stuff
Sonia: I'll take care of it

Chandler: Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop! Swoop!
Ross: Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here's a question: "Would you... would you rather drown or be burnt alive?"
Blonde girl: Sorry...we were just leaving

Rachel: No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly. Gavin come out from behind that curtain!
Gavin: Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand there.
Molly: Hello! I just go and get Emma.

Phoebe: OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
Monica: Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...
Mike: Well I've got a book around...

Ross: This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.
Chandler: By drowning or...?!
Michelle: Why would he break up with me?
Her friend: I don't know sweetie.

Mike: All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of "I touch myself". Coming up next we've got Monica singing "Delta Dawn".
Monica: Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
Phoebe: Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone anyway.

Monica: Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn" "Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone by? ..."
Phoebe: Can you totally see through her shirt ?
Mike: Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.

Monica: I can't believe I did this. I can't believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that one shouting "look at those tips"! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?
Mike: Sure.
Phoebe: Mon', not that you didn't sound good, but...

Michelle: No don't worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.
Ross:. Good choice Ross.
Rachel: Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I've been looking for you everywhere!

Ross: How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that's my roommate, Rachel.
Rachel: Hi, and I am also Emma's mother.
Michelle: Ah, who is Emma?

Monica: Ok, for my next song I think I'll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the Pointer Sisters' I am so excited. And make it bouncy!
Phoebe: Oh you'll probably take care of that on your hands.
Chandler: I am sorry I am late. You'll understand when you'll see Joey.

Monica: And they love me!
Chandler: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Yes, she gives the people what they want.

Monica: "Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in this time and show me some affection..."
Chandler: Are those my wife's nipples?
Phoebe: Oh? Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again.

Rachel: What, what, wait a minute! You haven't even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like an hour?
Michelle: Actually about an hour and a half.
Ross: I told you it wasn't long, but there is an amazing connection between us.

Michelle: Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?
Ross: We'll see.
Rachel: Ok, Ross, what's going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?

Ross: When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?
Rachel: Oh, that's what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?
Michelle: No, actually, see I had to pee, 'cause I can't use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites.

Joey: Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?
Ross: Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Raych, when will we expect to see you tonight?
Rachel: Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...

Joey: She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
Rachel: Bye!
Ross: Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.

Rachel: Well, Phoebe set me up on a date. 
Monica: Oh my god.
Chandler: Wow.

Rachel: What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.
Chandler: Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
Monica: You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!

Waiter: Ooh...
Ross: Just the crab cakes.
Waiter 2: What are you doing? Are you trying to get him to stay? Because you can't do that.

Monica: No, we weren't!
Joey: Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair.  You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
Chandler: All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.

Joey: Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this. 
Chandler: No, no, no.
Monica: No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!

Rachel: Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.
Ross: Female body inspector? What size is that?
Phoebe: Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?
Joey: Uh-huh.

Phoebe: Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.
Ross: The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.
Rachel: Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.

Ross: Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.
Joey: We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.
Phoebe: Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.

Chandler:  Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what...
Joey: Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?! 
Monica:  Really?  Let's get past the moment. 
Phoebe: What's your news? 

Chandler: Thank you. I got a job in advertising. 
Monica:  Oh, honey, that's incredible! 
Phoebe:  Gosh, what's the pay like?  Oh, come on people... come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most!  Hey Joey! 

Chandler:  Humiliating and noble! 
Ross: You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising. 
Monica: Ross, you did not come up with "got milk?" 

Joey: Yeah, yeah, and directing. 
Monica:  He was so good in that movie of MacBeth. 
Rachel:  You saw that? 

Monica: No, but...I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass. 
Rachel and Joey:  Ah! 
Joey: Yeah, he's done some amazing works. 
Rachel: Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials. 

Receptionist: This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze. 
Joey: It is so amazing to meet you.  I'm such a big fan of your work. 
Lennart: Well, I've...I've been blessed with a...a lot of great roles. 

Phoebe: Oh, I hear divorce bells. 
Mugger: Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem. 
Ross:  What? 

Mugger: Alright, lady, now give me your purse!
Phoebe: No. 
Ross:  What do you mean "no"? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay. 

Phoebe:  I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross. 
Lowell: Ross, nice to meet you. 
Ross: Yeah, a real pleasure. 

Monica: So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience. 
Chandler: Yes, but I don't think life experience with these. 
Joey: Wooooooooow  It's like they're on fire!

Monica: What are they? 
Chandler: They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these. 
Joey:  I'll give you $500 for them! 

All: Hey, hey! 
Ross: Hey, you'll never guess what just happened...Phoebe and I got mugged! 
Monica: You okay?! 

Ross:  Yeah, because Phoebe knew the mugger! 
Monica:  How do you know a mugger? 
Phoebe: I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us. 

Ross: You wanna know how she knew him?  Because Phoebe used to mug people. 
Monica:  Seriously? 
Phoebe: Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know...sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I...

Monica: You're mother killed herself! 
Phoebe: She was a drug dealer! 
Ross: Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because  I was about to do some serious damage! 

Phoebe:  You were? 
Ross: Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics...you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble Spiderman got into that week- 
Monica:  Wonderwoman! 

Phoebe: Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said- 
Phoebe and Monica: "Geology rocks!" 
Monica: Oh my god! 

Receptionist: No, Lennart doesn't wait! 
Joey: But I'm bursting with u-hu! 
Lennart:  Joey! Here we go. Let's go very quickly! 

Monica: What are you doing? 
Chandler: Putting on the sneakers...thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything...
Rachel: Oh, anything yet? 

Chandler: Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet! 
Joey:  Hey! 
All: Hey! 

Joey: We gotta get more of that. 
Chandler:  You know what...these aren't half-bad!  You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren. 
Rachel: Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph. 

Intern: ...and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other! 
Boss:  That's interesting! Just one thought: You didn't mention the shoes. Who's next?  Chander...
Chandler: Okay... You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age...

Intern:  Your age? 
Chandler: A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know...maybe he falls...maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "Not suitable for adults!" 
Boss: Chandler, that's great! 

Monica: Yeah.
Joey: That's right I am!  
Rachel: Hi you guys!
Joey  Monica: Hey!

Joey: Oh...baby-proofing...Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know...when I was a kid it was like... "Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!" or er... "Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!" Huh!
Monica: Anyway erm...Are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
Rachel: No. I was just going to do this myself.  

Joey: Oh...Women can. You...can't.
Rachel: Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
Monica: You're a pig. And you can't do this.

Phoebe: Hey you guys! Ok...we've got great news.
Mike: Phoebe and I are moving in together.
Monica, Chandler, Ross: Congratulations!Good for you!Great!

Phoebe: I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.
Monica: Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like". 
Chandler: Yeah...she's not so cute.
Mike: I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

Phoebe: OK...Well you put down the toilet seat.
Mike: Yes dear.
Monica: Is that a bit you guys do?

Phoebe: Uh huh...we're playing you two.
Monica: We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
Chandler: Yes dear.
Ross: I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's...that's great! I mean...I'm happy for you guys.

Monica: I hear wedding bells.
Phoebe: Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean...I don't know...Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah...You know...I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know...near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior... Oh my god I do.
Ross: Phoebe...I had no idea you were so conventional.

Phoebe: Yeah! You bet roomy!
Monica: Don't you mean...groomy?
Mike: What are you talking about?

Chandler: What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
Woman: Excuse me.
Joey: Boob job.

Rachel: Oh thank you so much. Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm...Your game.
Handyman: Thanks.
Chandler: Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.

Rachel: Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
Monica: Thank you?
Chandler: Oh no...don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not...TWO...single things.

Monica: o...k.
Chandler: I mean...You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
Rachel: Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any weirder.

Chandler: Honey I...I love your breasts the way they are!
Rachel: Argh. .
Monica: Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.

Rachel: Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
Joey: Because she is!
Monica: Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.

Ross: Hey! What do you guys think about this. Ross. The Divorce-Force.
Phoebe: Better.
Mike: Very cool.

Ross: You know, sometimes your words, they hurt.
Joey: Hey eh...where do you guys want this?
Rachel: Yeah...seriously coz this is really heavy.  I mean not for me because I'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.
Phoebe: Just one last time erm...the marriage thing...there's no wiggle room? None at all?
Mike: No but... You don't want to get married either right?

Phoebe: Right. Except that I do want to get married.
Joey: Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
Mike: You...wanna get married?

Chandler: Hey! Ready to go?
Ross: Oh yeah, let me just finish this.
Joey: Hey Ross, check this out!  yeah, I can't do that!

Chandler: Let me see what you wrote about yourself: "Doctor Paleontology, two kids... "  You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!
Ross: You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.
Joey: Hey! 

Ross:  What do you think you learned how to do in the last two minutes?? 
Chandler: Maybe we finish this for him!  "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!
Joey:  No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!

Phoebe: That was a test and you just failed.
Monica: Damn it! Rookie mistake!
Ross:  I have sex with dinosaurs??
Chandler: I believe I read that somewhere!

Monica: What are you doing?
Chandler: Oh, you'll see my friend.
Ross:  I'm dead?

Phoebe: What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
Monica:  What are you doing here?
Mike: Phoebe called me.

Monica: I've been pretty good!
Mike:  You look really beautiful.
Phoebe: Thanks, you look good too.

Monica: Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
Phoebe: So how's the piano playing going?
Mike: Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.

Monica: Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.
Mike: I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.
Phoebe: I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?

Mike: It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time... I never would have stopped.
Monica:  Kiss him, you fool!!
Phoebe: What?

Monica: Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
Phoebe: Oh, I missed you so much! 
Strange man:  I knew you'd be here!
Mike: Oh, crap!

Phoebe: Who is this?
Mike: My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.
Monica: Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!
Manny: Well, you are not doing a very good job!

Ross: Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! 
Monica: Hi, glad you could come.
Chandler:  Please, come in.
Tom: Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class.

Chandler: Some guy, Tom Gordon.
Ross: I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives. 
Monica: So, did you know Ross well?
Tom: Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone?

Monica:  Yes, he is. Me.
Tom: What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?
Chandler:  Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!! 

Tom:  Hey, listen. Call me.
Chandler: Ok! 
Ross:  I'm dead and no one cares?
Monica: I look like a man??

Chandler: I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
Kori: I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.
Ross:  But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!

Joey: Uh!
Monica: Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.
Chandler: Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!
Phoebe: Hey will you get me tickets too?
Rachel: Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it!
Everyone almost simultaneously except Ross: yeah thats a great idea!
Ross: No thanks!

Phoebe: You don't wanna win the lottery?
Ross: Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
Chandler: Still on Amelia Earhart?

Ross: No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
Chandler: Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
Joey: I like those odds!

Ross: Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
Rachel: Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
Monica: How do you know she's gonna start talking?

Monica: I'm parked in a garage on Morton! 
Ross: They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.
Joey: Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma!  Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?
Rachel: Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!

Joey: Oh yeah! The casserole lady.
Monica: So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?
Ross: Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
Chandler: Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!! 

Ross: Think he washed his hands?
Chandler: Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?
Rachel: What's going on?
Monica: Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.
Joey: Ooh! Tough odds!

Ross: Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!
Joey: Look who's coming around!
Chandler: Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.

Joey: By you!?
Chandler: Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
Monica: Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!

Chandler: Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie.
Phoebe: Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!
Monica: Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.
Ross: A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!

Monica: Ok, hey Rach?
Rachel: Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.
Joey: I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
Phoebe: I hope I win!

Monica: I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?
Joey: I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
Rachel, Chandler and Monica: Please, just do it!
Phoebe: One, two, three!

Joey: I won, hey!
Ross: You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp!  Ah!! That thing gets hot!!
Rachel: You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?

Ross: Why would I eat my own arm?
Chandler: Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.
Monica: You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.

Ross: You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here 
Phoebe: Get a room!
Chandler: Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?

Ross: I don't know, probably just invest it.
Chandler: Ooh! Calm down ...
Joey: Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it? 

Ross: Oh, I'm sorry, did I say "invest it"? I meant "be cool and piss it all away" 
Joey: Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!
Rachel: I don't really care about the Knicks.

Joey: Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.
Rachel:  You would do that? I never get picked!
Chandler: You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.

Joey: You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!
Chandler: You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.
Ross:  Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?

Chandler:  I'll take this one too  Uh ... Mommy?
Ross: Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...
Rachel: I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.

Ross:  Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi ..  no I can't.
Chandler: Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye. 
Joey: Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?

Chandler: He's the boss's son.
Monica: Come on, lottery!! 
Rachel: Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.

Monica: Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.
Phoebe: Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
Ross: I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!

Monica: Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!
Ross: 3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...
Joey: I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?

Monica: When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!
Joey:  I'll show you how.
Rachel: Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?

Monica: Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!
Rachel: Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
Chandler:  She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...

Monica: Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!
Rachel:  OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets !
Joey: Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!
Ross: Than I want mine, too ! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.
Phoebe: Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together 

Monica: No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!
Joey: Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea! 
Chandler: Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!
Rachel: Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up! 

Joey:  Oh!
Phoebe:  OOOOOHHHHH!
Ross:  Hey, hey!!

Phoebe:  OOOOOHHHHH!  Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! 
Rachel: Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.
Joey: No, no! 

Phoebe: No, what's more important, your friends or money?
Everyone but Monica: Friends! 
Monica: Money!  Friends...

Phoebe: Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?
Monica: They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ...
Ross: Monica!

Phoebe: As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die.  So, excuse me for being a little skittish.
Chandler:  Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!
Monica: Oh, play them!

Chandler: Ok, here we go! 
Message:  "Hello. Th-this is the pigeon from the balcony calling to apologise"  "I sh.. I shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand. It-it was all my fault. Not hers. Bye. Coo."
Phoebe: Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.
Second message: "Hey Chandler, it's Charlie"

Chandler: This is..shhh!
Second Message: "Listen, oh... it turns I got the last spot. I'm really sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. Give me a call if you want."
Monica: Oh God, I am so sorry honey...
All: Oh, so sorry man! Sorry!
Rachel: Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.

Chandler: Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?
Rachel: No, she was just much better at job than me!
Phoebe: Guys, the drawing is about to start!

Rachel:  You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.
Ross: Oh yeah, it's a good idea!
Monica:  Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.
Chandler: Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it.  But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?

Monica:  131! 
Ross:  Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl...  Phoebe's totally ruined that for me... 
Rachel: Hi mum, put her back on!
Joey:  Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing.
TV: "Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53"
Chandler: I got that!

Ross:  Come on!!
Rachel:  Mum, please!I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter?
TV: "And number 29! Here we go! The Powerball is 7"
Monica: Check your numbers! Make me rich!

Rachel:  Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!
All: Wow!
Joey: And what did she say?

Ross: She's gonna be a scientist! 
Joey:  Damnit! anybody got anything?
Chandler: No.
Phoebe: I'm still looking through mine...
Monica: Just double checking ...no, no, no... No!

Monica:  Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
Chandler: Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys.  Hey, Steve.
Steve: Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.

Chandler: What?  Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
Everybody:  Oh my God, congratulations!
Monica: Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!

Chandler: Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
Monica: You bet! No TV or anything! 
Joey:  Hey, that is so great about the job. 

Chandler:  Oh yeah?  Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out.
Joey: Oh yeah.
Rachel: You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
Ross: Me too. So much for my dinosaurAmelia Earhart theme park.
Phoebe: You guys, what was the Powerball number again?
Monica and Ross: Seven.

Joey:  Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.
Phoebe: I beg to differ .
Gunther: Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy in here earlier, and he found the ticket on the street, right outside, and won $10,000 .

Monica: Hey! 
Phoebe: Hey! 
Ross: Hi! 

Monica: So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks? 
Phoebe: Sure! 
Ross: I'd love to! 

Monica: Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month! 
Phoebe: Well, I can't give you a massage, because my license has been revoked again! 
Ross: Phoebe, what happened? 

Phoebe: Oh, good! Ok, good for you! Try to recapture the magic! 
Chandler: So, what do you say? Can you get out of work? 
Monica: Oh, honey! I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant! 

Chandler: Oh, that's ok. I'll just try and reschedule.  Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it.  Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time?  Oh, can't you make an exception? 
Monica: Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant! 
Phoebe: And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing! 

Chandler: I don't have travel insurance. 
Ross: Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge! 
Monica: Why don't you take Ross? 

Rachel: Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"! 
Joey: Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff! 
Director: Joey, Joey! We're ready for you! 

ActressOlivia: No, I told you... get out! 
JoeyDrake: Fine. I'll go. But let me ask you one question... 
Chase Lassiter:  You look familiar, have we... 
Rachel: SSSHHHHTTT!!! He's asking her a question!!! 

1st Customer: Everything was delicious! 
Monica: Thank you! 
2nd Customer: It was. The duck in particular was superb. 

Chandler: I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here. 
Ross: Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody. 
Receptionist: I am sorry Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer. 

Chandler: Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please? 
Ross:  Check again please! 
Receptionist: I'm sorry, it's not here. 

Ross: Not there. 
Chandler: Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation? 
Receptionist: I don't know what to say. 

Ross:  She doesn't know what to say! 
Chandler: Just give us the cheapest room you have. 
Receptionist: Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars. 

Joey: Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here. 
Rachel: Okay.  .  Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here. 
JoeyDrake: I can't believe you married him. 
Rachelactress: But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon! 

JoeyDrake: How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now. 
Rachel:  Kiss me. 
Joey: What? 

Rachel: You took the same class twice. 
Monica: It was hard! 
Phoebe: Hey! 
Rachel and Monica: Hi. 

Phoebe: My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant? 
Rachel: Ok, we're still on that. 
Monica: I didn't say your songs were not good enough. 

Joey: Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
Chandler: I could fall asleep at a play.
Phoebe: What is it?

Joey: It's a one-woman play called "Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life".
Monica: It sounds interesting!
Ross: Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett... 
Phoebe: I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?

Joey: I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
Chandler:  Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
Rachel:  Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.

Joey:  Hey, here you go.
Rachel: Ooh... oooh...   oh, ah...   Can I ask you a question?
Monica: Yeah.

Ross: Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!

Ross:  These aren't suede.
Charlie:  Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?
Gunther: No.

Ross: Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.
Monica:  Is he gonna introduce us?
Chandler:  No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
Charlie: And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.

Jane:  Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.
Joey:  Hey!
Rachel: Hey!

Joey: Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first
Rachel: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... 
Message: "Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight" 

Professor Spafford: If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom. 
Charlie: Oh my God!!
Ross: I've lost the will to live.

Ross: Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.
Phoebe: Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too!  Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?
Charlie: Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas...

Phoebe: Ah, ah.
Charlie:  Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me. 
Ross:  Ranion's theory of species variegation?

Phoebe: Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!
Monica:  So, did you two have fun?
Ross: Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...

Monica: And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a  HOTTY!!  HI!
Rachel:  Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.
Ross: Really? Wh-what's wrong?

Rachel: Ok!  Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
Monica:  WHAT?
Ross:  Wh-what's going on?

Monica: Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
Rachel: And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!
Charlie: I thought you came to say you were sick.

Rachel: Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!
Phoebe: And that horrible museum tour!
Ross: No, I arranged that...
Joey:  Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.

Phoebe: We know about your party Joey.
Joey: What party?
Monica: The game's over! Take off your robe!

Joey:  Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it  Thanks for coming.
Monica: Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
Kyle Lowder:  Hi. 

Monica: Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
Matthew Ashford: It was nice to meet you Rachel.
Rachel: Nice to meet you.

Matthew Ashford: Call me.
Rachel: Ok
Monica:  We will!!

Monica: Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! 
Ross:  So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
Charlie: Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone.

Ross: Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? 
Phoebe: Hey Ross!
Rache: How is it going with Charlie?

Joey: Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.  Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. 
Ross: Nice to meet you.
Dirk: Hey! So what show are you on?

Ross: Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.
Joey: It's a science.
Dirk: Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on "Days". And my character has just won the Nobel prize.

Joey: Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...
Ross: Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
Dirk: Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.

Ross: I'd lead with that.
Monica: That's it, just sign right on the bra .
Joey: Monica!

Monica: Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!
Joey:  What have you got there?
Rachel: Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.

Joey: Gotcha.
Rachel: Oh, Very funny... Joey.
Chandler:  So, how did you enjoy the play?
Monica: Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.

Phoebe: Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!
Ross: Stop going through my stuff !
Rachel:  Hey!
Monica: Hey!

Phoebe: Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
Chandler: Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
Monica: Oh, you're so wonderful.
Bitter woman: Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period.

Monica: It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
Ross: Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
Chandler: I missed most of the party  Charlie's a girl, right?

Ross: Why do you care so much?
Monica: Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?
Rachel:  Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women!  I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.

Ross: Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...
Phoebe: Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!
Rachel: All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...

Ross: Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!
Joey: Hey!
All: Hi!

Ross: Ok. 
Chandler:  So, a professor, uh?
Joey: Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious .  That's not how she used it...?
Charlie:  I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really hope you don't think less of me.

Phoebe: Oh... then I overpaid. 
Monica: Hey, what's this?
Rachel: Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.

Monica: Do you wanna go hunting?
Rachel: Well, I would like to have the option!!
Phoebe:  What's up?  Hey, Rachel!!

Rachel: Oh!
Phoebe: No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!
Monica: And she wants to go hunting, too!!

Rachel: Alright-y then.
Receptionist: Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.
Phoebe: Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around?  Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?

Chandler: I have a weird feeling about this place.  How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
Monica: Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.
Nurse: Mr. Bing?  Here you are! You'll go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container.

Chandler: Yeah, I guess!
Monica: I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!
Janice: OH MY GOD!!

Chandler: Oh, Come on!
Janice: Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!
Monica: Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!

Ross: Hey!
Charlie: Hey!
Joey:  You're ready?

Charlie: Yeah, let's go.   Thanks Ross.
Joey:  Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.
Ross: Glad I could help man.

Charlie:  So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!
Joey: So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
Rachel:  Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!

Joey: Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
Rachel: Oh, well...
Charlie: I'm sure you have better things to do.

Joey: Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.
Charlie: If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.
Rachel: Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!

Joey: What's the matter, Pheebs?
Phoebe: Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like "Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
Rachel: Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!

Phoebe: Ok, that'll be great!
Joey: Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
Rachel: That's not what we're gonna do!

Chandler: Hi.
Monica: Hi.
Doctor Connelly: I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.

Monica: Ok.
Doctor Connelly: Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
Chandler: Oh, DAMN IT!

Rachel: Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?
Charlie: Oh, yeah! Let's do it!
Joey:  Alright, have a good time. 

Rachel: Hi.
Ross: Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
Charlie: Umh... Kurts Baley?

Ross: Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  Well, why are you laughing?
Joey: Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!
Charlie: So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?

Ross: It's in Barbados.
Chandler: But you come first!
Rachel: I'm there!
Charlie: We'll see you, guys! 
Joey: Bye.

Rachel: Bye, see ya. 
Chandler:  Ok.
Joey: All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?

Chandler: I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
Joey: Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!
Ross:  What?

Shop assistant:  Incentive For Men?
Phoebe: Oh, I'll take some of that.
Rachel: Pheebs, that's for men!

Phoebe: Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. . Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!
Charlie:  So, you know what, I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. Where do you think those would be?
Rachel: On Melanie Griffith in "Working girl". I think what you want is over here.

Charlie: You've seen all the movies...
Rachel: Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!
Phoebe:  Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?

Rachel: Sure!
Phoebe: Ok!
Charlie: Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!

Monica: Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!
Zack:  You too.
Chandler: You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite!  Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.

Monica: I got it.
Zack: Thanks.
Chandler:  So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?

Monica: Uh!
Chandler:  Zack!
Zack: Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring.

Monica: Hey guys! Dinner's ready!
Zack: Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first.  Thanks!
Chandler: So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!

Monica: I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
Chandler: Alright! Just follow my lead!
Zack: You guys have such a great place here.

Chandler:  That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
Zack:  Okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet.
Monica: Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?

Phoebe: Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.
Charlie: Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with?
Rachel: No, that's David.

Charlie: There's a third guy?
Rachel:  Tip of the iceberg.
Zack: I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?
Chandler: You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?

Chandler: My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
Jeanette:  Here are the boards for Friday's pitch .
Zack: Oh, thank you.

Joey: Barbados!
Ross: Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right!  This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
Rachel: Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
Chandler: Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, "island's stuff".
Phoebe: I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.

Charlie: Wow! This place is beautiful!
Ross:  Look at all these paleontologists!!
Joey: I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! 
Woman: Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!

Joey: That... never happens...
Woman: I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech.
Ross: Wow! This is very flattering, uh...

Woman: Sarah.
Ross: "... Sarah. I dig you", Uh? "Doctor Ross Geller".
Sarah: Thank you so much!

Ross: Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.
Sarah:  Are you a paleontologist?
Joey: No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called "The Days of Our Lives".

Ross: Dude, it's just "Days of Our Lives"... there's no the.
Joey:  Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.
Sarah: I'm sorry, I don't own a TV.

Phoebe: Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!
Chandler:  She does?
Monica:  Let's get you out of here!! 

Joey: Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
Ross: Yeah, she never misses these conferences!  No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
Charlie: Oh my God! Did you talk to him?

Ross:  Ready to go?
Charlie: Yeah!
Joey: Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?

Charlie: I will if you will.
Joey: Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
Ross:  I'm good, I have dinner plans .

Charlie: So you'll be ok?
Joey: Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...
Ross: Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?

Joey: Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!
Rachel: Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
Monica: Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!
Chandler: That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!

Joey: Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in 
Monica:  Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!
Phoebe:  Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!

Monica:  And make sure our room isn't next to theirs .
Rachel: Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could  share that with a guy.
Phoebe: Not Joey.

Rachel: Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.
Monica: Yeah, right!
David: So, um... I'm proposing to Phoebe tonight. 
Chandler: Tonight?!  Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond?  Oh, there it is!

Chandler: That would be advice!!
Monica: Ok fine. I'll handle this.  Phoebe?
Phoebe: Yeah?

Monica:  I need to talk to you.
Phoebe: Are you leaving "The Supremes"? 
MOnica: Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.

Ross: The chocolates aren't here yet.
Joey: Damnit!
Charlie: Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!
Chandler: Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?

Ross: If you want to check your email, just ask! 
Chandler:  What?  May I?
Rachel:  What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.
Charlie: Actually the wet season is June to December.

Rachel: It's not the time Charlie.
Chandler:  Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!
Joey: Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot?  Oh! Secret teapot?

Chandler: Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
Time lapse: Ross looks likes he's been trying to fix his computer but just closes it as if giving up
Joey: It's really gone?
Ross: Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!

Chandler: Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but...  you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... 
Ross: Get out! 
Rachel: You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.

Ross: Wha... what you really think we can do that?
Charlie: Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner .
Joey: Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.
Rachel: Ugh.

Joey: Yeah.
Ross and Charlie: Hey!
Charlie:  I just left you a message! Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner.

Joey: Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
Ross: Yep, we got it, we got it.  Thank you so much.
Charlie: I had a great time.

Joey: Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...
Rachel: Later! La...
Charlie: So, shall we?

Joey: Yeah. 
Rachel: Ok. See you, bye.
Charlie: Bye.
Ross: Good night.

Monica: I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
Chandler: You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
David: Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have... something I wanna say.

Monica: Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
Chandler: I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk?  "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honored, uh..." Spit it out, David!
David: Uh, Phoebe, uh...  you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!
Phoebe: Sure, ok, yeah.

David:  Hi Mike!
Mike: Hi David. Chandler. Monica...  Oh!
Monica: IT'S THE HUMIDITY!

Mike: Sorry David, but she really has to know this.
David: Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.
Monica: You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring...

David: Um... Ha ha!
Phoebe: I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.
