...and make complete fools of ourselves. What do you say?

I can't even stand in front of a tap class.

I thought that movie was so incredibly boring.

这是在干什么? 他再等一年离家,到社区话剧团去

I thought,"That's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back."
走出电影院时我想, 我这逝去两小时的生命,永远不再回

They take,like,dogs and cows.

See,I don't know who this is harder on,me or him.

Apparently,he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered people.

Let me ask you some questions about Marcel.
